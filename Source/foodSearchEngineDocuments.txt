If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process.Share on PinterestThere is only a limited amount of food you can eat in a single day.To maximize the amount of nutrients you take in, it makes sense to spend your calorie budget wisely.The best way to do that is to simply eat the foods that carry the greatest amount and variety of nutrients.Here are the 11 most nutrient-dense foods on the planet. 1. SalmonNot all fish is created equal.Salmon — and other fatty types of fish — contain the greatest amount of omega-3s fatty acids.Omega-3s are extremely important for the optimal function of your body. They’re linked to improved wellbeing and a lower risk of many serious diseases (1).Although salmon is mainly prized for its beneficial composition of fatty acids, it also packs a massive amount of other nutrients.A 100-gram piece of wild salmon contains 2.8 grams of omega-3s, along with lots of high-quality animal protein and ample vitamins and minerals, including large amounts of magnesium, potassium, selenium and B vitamins (2).It is a good idea to eat fatty fish at least once or twice a week to get all the omega-3s your body needs.Studies show that people who eat fatty fish regularly have a lower risk of heart disease, dementia, depression and many other common diseases (3, 4, 5, 6).Also, salmon tastes good and is fairly simple to prepare. It also tends to make you feel full with relatively few calories.If you can, choose wild salmon instead of farmed. It is more nutritious, has a better omega-6 to omega-3 ratio and is less likely to contain contaminants (7, 8).Summary Fatty fish like salmon is loaded with beneficial fatty acids, protein, vitamins and minerals. It is a good idea to eat fatty fish every week. 2. KaleOf all the healthy leafy greens, kale is the king.It is loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants and various bioactive compounds.A 100-gram portion of kale contains (9):Vitamin C: 200% of the RDIVitamin A: 300% of the RDIVitamin K1: 1,000% of the RDILarge amounts of vitamin B6, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and manganeseThe same amount has 2 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein and only 50 calories.Kale may be even healthier than spinach. Both are very nutritious, but kale is lower in oxalates, which are substances that can bind minerals like calcium in your intestine, preventing them from being absorbed (10).Kale and other greens are also high in various bioactive compounds, including isothiocyanates and indole-3-carbinol, which have been shown to fight cancer in test-tube and animal studies (11, 12).Summary Kale is one of the most nutrient-dense vegetables you can eat, containing large amounts of vitamins, minerals and cancer-fighting compounds. 3. SeaweedThe sea has more than just fish. It also contains massive amounts of vegetation.There are thousands of different plant species in the ocean, some of which are very nutritious. Usually, they are referred to collectively as seaweed (13).Seaweed is popular in dishes like sushi. Many sushi dishes also include a type of seaweed known as nori, which is used as an edible wrapping.In many cases, seaweed is even more nutritious than land vegetables. It is particularly high in minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese (14).It is also loaded with various bioactive compounds, including phycocyanins and carotenoids. Some of these substances are antioxidants with powerful anti-inflammatory capacities (15).But seaweed really shines in its high content of iodine, a mineral your body uses to make thyroid hormones.Just eating a high-iodine seaweed like kelp a few times per month can give your body all the iodine it needs.If you don’t like the taste of seaweed, you can also take it in supplement form. Dried kelp tablets are very cheap and loaded with iodine.Summary Sea vegetables are highly nutritious but rarely consumed in the West. They are particularly high in iodine, which is essential for optimal thyroid function. 4. GarlicGarlic really is an amazing ingredient.Not only can it turn all sorts of bland dishes delicious, it is also very nutritious.It is high in vitamins C, B1 and B6, calcium, potassium, copper, manganese and selenium (16).Garlic is also high in beneficial sulfur compounds such as allicin.Many studies show that allicin and garlic may lower blood pressure as well as total and “bad” LDL cholesterol. It also raises “good” HDL cholesterol, potentially reducing risk of heart disease down the line (17, 18, 19, 20).It also has various cancer-fighting properties. Studies show that people who eat a lot of garlic have a much lower risk of several common cancers, especially cancers of the colon and stomach (21, 22).Raw garlic also has significant antibacterial and antifungal properties (23, 24).Summary Garlic is both tasty and healthy. It is highly nutritious, and the bioactive compounds in it have confirmed disease-fighting properties. 5. ShellfishMany sea animals are high in nutrients, but shellfish may be among the most nutritious of all.Commonly consumed types of shellfish include clams, oysters, scallops and mussels.Clams are among the best sources of vitamin B12 in existence, with 100 grams of clams supplying over 16 times the RDI. They are also loaded with vitamin C, various B vitamins, potassium, selenium and iron (25).Oysters are also very nutritious. Only 100 grams supply 600% of the RDI for zinc, 200% of the RDI for copper and large amounts of vitamin B12, vitamin D and several other nutrients (26).Though shellfish are among the world’s most nutritious foods, most people rarely consume them.Summary Shellfish are some of the most nutritious animals found in the sea. They are very high in important nutrients like vitamin B12 and zinc. 6. PotatoesA single large potato is high in potassium, magnesium, iron, copper and manganese. It also contains vitamin C and most B vitamins (27).They contain a little bit of almost every nutrient you need. There are accounts of people living on nothing but potatoes for a long time.They are also one of the most filling foods. When researchers compared the satiety value of different foods, boiled potatoes scored higher than any other food measured (28).If you allow potatoes to cool after cooking, they also form resistant starch, a fiber-like substance with many powerful health benefits (29).Summary Potatoes contain a little bit of almost every nutrient you need. They are incredibly filling and can provide large amounts of resistant starch. 7. LiverHumans and our remote ancestors have been eating animals for millions of years.However, the modern Western diet has prioritized muscle meat over organ meats. Compared to the organs, muscle meat is nutritionally poor. Out of all the organs, liver is by far the most nutritious.The liver is a remarkable organ with hundreds of functions related to metabolism. One of its functions is to store important nutrients for the rest of your body.A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) portion of beef liver contains (30):Vitamin B12: 1,176% of the DVVitamin B5, vitamin B6, niacin and folate: Over 50% of the DVVitamin B2: 201% of the DVVitamin A: 634% of the DVCopper: 714% of the DVIron, phosphorus, zinc and selenium: Over 30% of the DVHigh-quality animal protein: 29 gramsEating liver once per week is a good way to ensure that you get optimal amounts of these vital nutrients.Summary Liver is a highly nutritious organ meat containing large amounts of B vitamins as well as other healthy substances. 8. SardinesSardines are small, oily fish that can be eaten whole.You can find sardines online.Given that the organs are usually the most nutritious parts of an animal, it is not surprising that whole sardines are very nourishing.They contain a little bit of almost every nutrient that your body needs and are nearly nutritionally perfect (31).Like other fatty fish, they’re also very high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.Summary Small, oily fish like sardines are usually eaten whole, giving you the organs, bones, brain and other nutritious parts. They contain a little bit of almost every nutrient you need. 9. BlueberriesWhen it comes to the nutritional value of fruits, blueberries are in a league of their own.Although not as high — calorie for calorie — in vitamins and minerals as vegetables, they’re packed with antioxidants.They are loaded with powerful antioxidant substances, including anthocyanins and various other plant compounds, some of which can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert protective effects on your brain (32).Several studies have examined the health effects of blueberries in humans.One study found that blueberries improved memory in older adults (33).Another study found that obese men and women with metabolic syndrome had a lowered blood pressure and reduced markers of oxidized LDL cholesterol when they added blueberries to their diet (34).This finding is in line with studies showing that blueberries increase the antioxidant value of your blood (35).Multiple test-tube and animal studies also suggest that blueberries can help fight cancer (36, 37, 38).Summary Blueberries are very nutritious compared to most fruits and are loaded with powerful antioxidants, some of which can increase the antioxidant value of your blood and safeguard your brain. 10. Egg YolksEgg yolks have been unfairly demonized because of their cholesterol content.However, studies show that dietary cholesterol isn’t something you generally need to worry about. Eating moderate amounts of cholesterol doesn’t raise the “bad” LDL cholesterol in your blood (39).Egg yolks are therefore one of the most nutritious foods on the planet. Whole eggs are so nutritious that they’re sometimes referred to as “nature’s multivitamin.”Egg yolks are loaded with vitamins, minerals and various powerful nutrients, including choline (40).They’re high in lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that can protect your eyes and reduce your risk of eye diseases like cataracts and macular degeneration (41).Eggs also contain high-quality protein and healthy fats. Several studies suggest that they can help you lose weight (42, 43).They are also cheap, flavorful and easy to prepare.If you can, buy pastured and/or omega-3 enriched eggs. They’re healthier and more nutritious than most conventional supermarket eggs (44, 45).Summary Whole eggs are so nutritious that they’re sometimes called “nature’s multivitamin.” The yolk is where almost all of the nutrients are found. 11. Dark Chocolate (Cocoa)Dark chocolate with a high cocoa content is one of the most nutritious foods you can eat.It is loaded with fiber, iron, magnesium, copper and manganese (46).But its biggest benefit is its amazing range of antioxidants.In fact, a study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate scored higher in antioxidants than any other food tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (47).Multiple studies in humans show that dark chocolate has powerful health benefits, including improved blood flow, lower blood pressure, reduced oxidized LDL and improved brain function (48, 49, 50).One study found that people who consumed chocolate more than five times per week had a 57% lower risk of heart disease (51).Given that heart disease is the most common cause of death worldwide, this finding could have implications for millions of people.Make sure to get dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content. The best ones contain 85% cocoa or higher.Eating a small square of quality dark chocolate every day may be one of the best ways to supplement your diet with additional antioxidants. You can find high-cocoa dark chocolate online.Summary Dark chocolate and cocoa are very high in minerals and antioxidants. Eating them regularly may provide various health benefits.\nThe Bottom LineIf you want lots of nutrients without many calories, the most obvious strategy is to take dietary supplements.However, supplements can hardly replace a healthy diet. A better way to get all the nutrients you need is to fill your meals with nutrient-dense foods. Nutrient-dense foods are rich in nutrients relative to their calorie content. These include various healthy foods such as whole vegetables, fruits, cocoa, seafood, eggs and liver. Start adding the above foods to your diet today to reap their benefits.ParenthoodWritten by Kris Gunnars, BSc on August 27, 2018related storiesDoes Nutrient Timing Matter?

Labelled as a vegetable for nutritional purposes, tomatoes are a good source of vitamin C and the phytochemical lycopene. The fruits are commonly eaten raw in salads, served as a cooked vegetable, used as an ingredient of various prepared dishes, and pickled. Additionally, a large percentage of the world’s tomato crop is used for processing; products include canned tomatoes, tomato juice, ketchup, puree, paste, and “sun-dried” tomatoes or dehydrated pulp.tomato, heirloomVariety of heirloom tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum).© Media Bakery\nRead More on This Topic\norigins of agriculture: Tomato-harvesting equipment\nThe self-propelled mechanical tomato harvester, developed in the early 1960s by engineers working in cooperation with plant breeders, handles...\nPhysical description and cultivation\nTomato plants are generally much branched, spreading 60–180 cm (24–72 inches) and somewhat trailing when fruiting, but a few forms are compact and upright. Leaves are more or less hairy, strongly odorous, pinnately compound, and up to 45 cm (18 inches) long. The five-petaled flowers are yellow, 2 cm (0.8 inch) across, pendant, and clustered. Fruits are berries that vary in diameter from 1.5 to 7.5 cm (0.6 to 3 inches) or more. They are usually red, scarlet, or yellow, though green and purple varieties do exist, and they vary in shape from almost spherical to oval and elongate to pear-shaped. Each fruit contains at least two cells of small seeds surrounded by jellylike pulp.hothouse tomatoesHothouse filled with tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). Given that tomatoes are a warm-weather crop, hothouses permit their cultivation in the winter or in cool climates. © AnnaC/Fotolia\nThe plant requires relatively warm weather and much sunlight; it is grown chiefly in hothouses in cooler climates. Tomatoes are usually staked, tied, or caged to keep the stems and fruits off the ground, and consistent watering is necessary to avoid blossom-end rot and cracking of the fruits. The plants are susceptible to a number of pests and diseases, including bacterial wilt, early blight, mosaic virus, Fusarium wilt, nematodes, and tomato hornworms. Many of these problems can be controlled with crop rotation, the use of fungicides and pesticides, and the planting of resistant varieties. The tiny currant tomato (S. pimpinellifolium) is a closely related species and has been used by breeders to hybridize several pest- and disease-resistant tomato varieties.tomato blossom-end rotBlossom-end rot of tomato, caused by unbalanced moisture and calcium deficiency.Nigel Cattlin—Holt Studios International/Photo Researchers, Inc.\nHistory\nThe wild species originated in the Andes Mountains of South America, probably mainly in Peru and Ecuador, and is thought to have been domesticated in pre-Columbian Mexico; its name is derived from the Náhuatl (Aztec) word tomatl. The tomato was introduced to Europe by the Spanish in the early 16th century, and the Spanish and Italians seem to have been the first Europeans to adopt it as a food. In France and northern Europe the tomato was initially grown as an ornamental plant and was regarded with suspicion as a food because botanists recognized it as a relative of the poisonous belladonna and deadly nightshade. Indeed, the roots and leaves of the tomato plant are poisonous and contain the neurotoxin solanine.\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription.\nSubscribe today\nThe Italians called the tomato pomodoro (“golden apple”), which has given rise to speculation that the first tomatoes known to Europeans were yellow. It has been suggested that the French called it pomme d’amour (“love apple”) because it was thought to have aphrodisiacal properties. Some scholars assert, however, that the tomato was at first taken to be a kind of eggplant, of which it is a close relative. The eggplant was called pomme des Mours (“apple of the Moors”) because it was a favourite vegetable of the Arabs, and pomodoro and pomme d’amour may be corruptions of that name.\nTomatoes were introduced to North America from Europe. Thomas Jefferson is known to have raised them at Monticello in 1781. The tomato was used for food in Louisiana as early as 1812, but not in the northeastern states until about 1835. It did not attain widespread popularity in the United States until the early 20th century. The plant is now grown commercially throughout the world.The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Melissa Petruzzello, Assistant Editor.\nLearn More in these related Britannica articles:\norigins of agriculture: Tomato-harvesting equipment\nThe self-propelled mechanical tomato harvester, developed in the early 1960s by engineers working in cooperation with plant breeders, handles virtually all packing tomatoes grown in California.

The other 5% consists mainly of carbohydrates and fiber.Here are the nutrients in a small (100-gram) raw tomato (1):Calories: 18Water: 95%Protein: 0.9 gramsCarbs: 3.9 gramsSugar: 2.6 gramsFiber: 1.2 gramsFat: 0.2 gramsCarbsCarbs comprise 4% of raw tomatoes, which amounts to fewer than 5 grams of carbs for a medium specimen (123 grams).Simple sugars, such as glucose and fructose, make up almost 70% of the carb content.FiberTomatoes are a good source of fiber, providing about 1.5 grams per average-sized tomato.Most of the fibers (87%) in tomatoes are insoluble, in the form of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin (2).SUMMARY Fresh tomatoes are low in carbs. The carb content consists mainly of simple sugars and insoluble fibers. These fruits are mostly made up of water. Vitamins and mineralsTomatoes are a good source of several vitamins and minerals:Vitamin C. This vitamin is an essential nutrient and antioxidant. One medium-sized tomato can provide about 28% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI).Potassium. An essential mineral, potassium is beneficial for blood pressure control and heart disease prevention (3).Vitamin K1. Also known as phylloquinone, vitamin K is important for blood clotting and bone health (4, 5).Folate (vitamin B9). One of the B vitamins, folate is important for normal tissue growth and cell function. It’s particularly important for pregnant women (6, 7).SUMMARY Tomatoes are a good source of several vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, potassium, vitamin K, and folate. Other plant compoundsThe content of vitamins and plant compounds in tomatoes can vary greatly between varieties and sampling periods (8, 9, 10).The main plant compounds in tomatoes are:Lycopene. A red pigment and antioxidant, lycopene has been extensively studied for its beneficial health effects (11).Beta carotene. An antioxidant that often gives foods a yellow or orange hue, beta carotene is converted into vitamin A in your body.Naringenin. Found in tomato skin, this flavonoid has been shown to decrease inflammation and protect against various diseases in mice (12).Chlorogenic acid. A powerful antioxidant compound, chlorogenic acid may lower blood pressure in people with elevated levels (13, 14).Chlorophylls and carotenoids like lycopene are responsible for the rich color of tomatoes.When the ripening process starts, the chlorophyll (green) is degraded and carotenoids (red) are synthesized (15, 16).LycopeneLycopene — the most abundant carotenoid in ripened tomatoes — is particularly noteworthy when it comes to the fruit's plant compounds.It's found in the highest concentrations in the skin (17, 18).Generally, the redder the tomato, the more lycopene it has (19).Tomato products — such as ketchup, tomato juice, tomato paste, and tomato sauces — are the richest dietary sources of lycopene in the Western diet, providing over 80% of dietary lycopene in the United States (20, 21).Gram for gram, the amount of lycopene in processed tomato products is often much higher than in fresh tomatoes (22, 23).For example, ketchup boasts 10–14 mg of lycopene per 3.5 ounces (100 grams), while one small, fresh tomato (100 grams) holds only 1–8 mg (24).However, keep in mind that ketchup is often consumed in very small amounts. Thus, it may be easier to bump up your lycopene intake by eating unprocessed tomatoes — which also have far less sugar than ketchup. Other foods in your diet may have a strong effect on lycopene absorption. Consuming this plant compound with a source of fat can increase absorption by up to four times (25).However, not everyone absorbs lycopene at the same rate (26).Even though processed tomato products are higher in lycopene, it’s still recommended to consume fresh, whole tomatoes whenever possible.SUMMARY Lycopene is one of the most abundant plant compounds in tomatoes. It’s found in the highest concentrations in tomato products, such as ketchup, juice, paste, and sauce. Health benefits of tomatoesConsumption of tomatoes and tomato-based products has been linked to improved skin health and a lower risk of heart disease and cancer.Heart healthHeart disease — including heart attacks and strokes — is the world's most common cause of death.A study in middle-aged men linked low blood levels of lycopene and beta-carotene to increased risk of heart attacks and strokes (27, 28).Increasing evidence from clinical trials suggests that supplementing with lycopene may help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol (29).Clinical studies of tomato products indicate benefits against inflammation and markers of oxidative stress (30, 31).They also show a protective effect on the inner layer of blood vessels and may decrease your risk of blood clotting (32, 33).Cancer preventionCancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that spread beyond their normal boundaries, often invading other parts of the body.Observational studies have noted links between tomatoes — and tomato products — and fewer incidences of prostate, lung, and stomach cancers (34, 35).While the high lycopene content is believed responsible, high-quality human research needed to confirm the cause of these benefits (36, 37, 38).A study in women shows that high concentrations of carotenoids — found in high amounts in tomatoes — may protect against breast cancer (39, 40).Skin healthTomatoes are considered beneficial for skin health.Tomato-based foods rich in lycopene and other plant compounds may protect against sunburn (41, 42).According to one study, people who ingested 1.3 ounces (40 grams) of tomato paste — providing 16 mg of lycopene — with olive oil every day for 10 weeks experienced 40% fewer sunburns (43).SUMMARY Studies show that tomatoes and tomato products may reduce your risk of heart disease and several cancers. This fruit is also beneficial for skin health, as it may protect against sunburns. Commercial ripening processWhen tomatoes start to ripen, they produce a gaseous hormone called ethylene (44, 45).Commercially grown tomatoes are harvested and transported while still green and immature. To make them red before selling, food companies spray them with artificial ethylene gas.This process inhibits the development of natural flavor and may result in tasteless tomatoes (46).Therefore, locally grown tomatoes may taste better because they’re allowed to ripen naturally.If you buy unripened tomatoes, you can speed up the ripening process by wrapping them in a sheet of newspaper and keeping them on the kitchen counter for a few days. Just make sure to check them daily for ripeness.SUMMARY Tomatoes are often harvested while still green and immature, then ripened artificially with ethylene gas. This may lead to less flavor development, resulting in bland tomatoes. Safety and side effectsTomatoes are generally well tolerated and tomato allergy is very rare (47, 48).AllergyAlthough tomato allergy is rare, individuals allergic to grass pollen are more likely to be allergic to tomatoes.This condition is called pollen-food allergy syndrome or oral-allergy syndrome (49).In oral-allergy syndrome, your immune system attacks fruit and vegetable proteins that are similar to pollen, which leads to allergic reactions like itching in the mouth, scratchy throat, or swelling of the mouth or throat (50).People with latex allergy can also experience cross-reactivity to tomatoes (51, 52).SUMMARY Tomatoes are generally well tolerated but may cause allergic reactions in people allergic to grass pollen.\nThe bottom lineTomatoes are juicy and sweet, full of antioxidants, and may help fight several diseases.They are especially high in lycopene, a plant compound linked to improved heart health, cancer prevention, and protection against sunburns.Tomatoes can be a valuable part of a healthy diet.Written by Adda Bjarnadottir, MS, RDN (Ice) on March 25, 2019related storiesIs a Tomato a Fruit or Vegetable?Is Tomato Juice Good for You?

The potato is native to the Peruvian-Bolivian Andes and is one of the world’s main food crops. Potatoes are frequently served whole or mashed as a cooked vegetable and are also ground into potato flour, used in baking and as a thickener for sauces. The tubers are highly digestible and supply vitamin C, protein, thiamin, and niacin.Harvested potatoes.© anweber/FotoliaknishKnish, a potato snack wrapped in thin pastry dough and baked or fried.Scott B.

Encountered by the invading Spaniards, potatoes were introduced into Europe during the second half of the 16th century. By the end of the 17th century the plant was a major crop in Ireland, and by the end of the 18th century it was a major crop in continental Europe, particularly Germany, and in the west of England.\nIt continued to spread, in both Western and Eastern hemispheres, during the first four decades of the 19th century, and the Irish economy itself became dependent upon the potato. However, the disastrous failures of the Irish crops in the mid-19th century (especially in 1846 and 1848), because of late blight (Phytophthora infestans), and the resulting Irish Potato Famine generated a more-cautious attitude toward dependence on the plant.blightPotato leaf infected with a fungal blight.FkThe potato is one of some 150 tuber-bearing species of the genus Solanum (a tuber is the swollen end of an underground stem). The compound leaves are spirally arranged; each leaf is 20–30 cm (about 8–12 inches) long and consists of a terminal leaflet and two to four pairs of leaflets. The white, lavender, or purple flowers have five fused petals and yellow stamens. The fruit is a small poisonous berry with numerous seeds.The stems extend underground into structures called stolons. The ends of the stolons may enlarge greatly to form a few to more than 20 tubers, of variable shape and size, usually ranging in weight up to 300 grams (10 ounces) but occasionally to more than 1.5 kg (3.3 pounds). The skin varies in colour from brownish white to deep purple; the starchy flesh normally ranges in colour from white to yellow, but it too may be purple. The tubers bear spirally arranged buds (eyes) in the axils of aborted leaves, of which scars remain. The buds sprout to form clones of the parent plant, allowing growers to vegetatively propagate desired characteristics. Indeed, vegetative reproduction is always used commercially, though the resulting decrease in genetic diversity has made the popular varieties more vulnerable to pests and diseases.potatoFreshly harvested potatoes (Solanum tuberosum).© Terry Brooks—Swellphotography/Dreamstime.com\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription.\nSubscribe today\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Adam Augustyn, Managing Editor, Reference Content.\nLearn More in these related Britannica articles:\nSolanales: Potato\nOne of the largest and best-known genera of flowering plants is Solanum (potato genus), which has some 1,250 to 1,700 species.

To the extent permitted by law, any claim or\ndispute must be filed within one year.\nThe one-year period begins when the arbitration notice first could be\nfiled.

Since the 1950s, however, processed potatoes — French fries and hash browns, for example — have grown more popular as the technology to freeze the vegetables has improved. According to the USDA, processed potatoes composed 64 percent of total U.S. potato use during the 2000s, compared to 35 percent in the 1960s. Americans, on average, eat 55 lbs. (35 kilograms) of frozen potatoes per year, 42 lbs. (19 kg) of fresh potatoes, 17 lbs. (8 kg) of potato chips and 14 lbs. (6 kg) of dehydrated potato products.Potatoes are often thought of as a comfort food — richly mashed with butter and sour cream or crisply fried in vegetable oil. But when prepared in these ways, they can lead to weight gain, diabetes and heart disease, according to the Harvard School of Public Health.\xa0In fact, a study published in 2017 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people who ate fried potatoes twice a week saw an increased risk of death. The study examined potato intake in 4,400 people between the ages of 45 and 79. By the end of the eight-year study, 236 people had died. Researchers found that those who ate fried potatoes — French fries, hash browns, home fries and more — were more than twice as likely to have died.\xa0The study did not, however, find any correlation between non-fried potato consumption and risk of death. This supports the stance of Victoria Jarzabkowski, a nutritionist with the Fitness Institute of Texas at The University of Texas at Austin: potatoes aren’t necessarily bad for you. When cooked the right way — without heaps of butter, cheese or cream — they can even be good for you.\xa0Potatoes are low in calories — a medium-sized baked potato contains only about 110 calories. They are a good source of vitamins C and B6, manganese, phosphorus, niacin and pantothenic acid. Nutrition factsHere are the nutrition facts for a potato, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates food labeling through the National Labeling and Education Act:\nPotato Serving size: 1 medium (5.3 oz. / 148 g) Calories 110; Calories from Fat 0 *Percent Daily Values (%DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.Amt per Serving%DV*Amt per Serving%DV*Total Fat 0g0%Total Carbohydrate 26g9%Cholesterol 0mg0%Dietary Fiber 2g8%Sodium 8mg0%Sugars 1gProtein 3gVitamin A0%Calcium2%Vitamin C45%Iron6%\nHealth benefitsPotatoes are stuffed with phytonutrients, which are organic components of plants that are thought to promote health, according to the USDA. Phytonutrients in potatoes include carotenoids, flavonoids and caffeic acid.\xa0The vitamin C in potatoes acts as an antioxidant. These substances may prevent or delay some types of cell damage, according to the National Institutes of Health. They may also help with digestion, heart health, blood pressure and even cancer prevention.Purple potatoes are especially good sources of phytonutrients and antioxidants. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry found that six to eight small purple potatoes twice a day helped lower blood pressure and risk of heart disease and stroke among people who were overweight and suffering from hypertension. Despite the carbohydrates in purple potatoes, the participants did not gain weight.\xa0Blood pressurePotatoes may help lower blood pressure for several reasons. Jarzabkowski said that the fiber found in potatoes could help lower cholesterol by binding with cholesterol in the blood. "After it binds, we excrete it.”\xa0Potatoes are also a good source of potassium. "All potatoes are potassium rich," Jarzabkowski said. "They have even more potassium than a banana, and a lot of it is found in the [potato\'s] skin." She noted that the outer potato peel also contains a good deal of fiber. Potassium is a mineral that helps lower blood pressure, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Potassium, too, can help lower blood pressure through its actions as a vasodilator (blood vessel widener). Scientists at the Institute for Food Research have discovered that potatoes contain chemicals called kukoamines, which are associated with lowering blood pressure.Brain functioning and nervous system healthThe B6 vitamins in potatoes are critical to maintaining neurological health. Vitamin B6 helps create useful brain chemicals, including serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. This means that eating potatoes may help with depression, stress and even perhaps attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Potatoes\' high level of carbohydrates may have some advantages, including helping maintain good levels of glucose in the blood, which is necessary to proper brain functioning. A 1995 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that modest increases in glucose could help enhance learning and memory. Potassium, which encourages the widening of blood vessels, also helps ensure your brain gets enough blood.ImmunityVitamin C can help prevent everything from scurvy to the common cold, and potatoes are full of this nutrient, with about 45 percent of the recommended daily intake per medium baked potato, according to the Washington State Potato Commission.\xa0InflammationSome people think potatoes and other members of the nightshade family — such as eggplants, tomatoes and peppers — trigger arthritis flares. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support this hypothesis, according to the Arthritis Foundation. The organization suggests that people with arthritis try cutting nightshade vegetables from their diets for two weeks to see if symptoms improve.\xa0Some studies suggest these vegetables may actually help reduce arthritis symptoms, the foundation said. For example, a 2011 study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that potatoes might reduce inflammation.DigestionThe largest health benefit offered by potatoes is how they can help with digestion due to their high fiber content, Jarzabkowski said. Potatoes\' high level of carbohydrates makes them easy to digest, while their fiber-filled skin can help keep you regular.\xa0Heart healthPotatoes give your heart plenty of reasons to swoon, due to the fiber content. Jarzabkowski said fiber is associated with clearing cholesterol from blood vessels; vitamins C and B6 help reduce free radicals; and carotenoids help maintain proper heart functioning.\xa0Additionally, B6 plays a crucial role in the methylation process, which, among other things, changes the potentially dangerous molecule homocysteine into methionine, a component in new proteins, according to Harvard. Too much homocysteine can damage blood vessel walls, and high levels of it are associated with increased risk of heart attack and stroke.Athletic performanceJarzabkowski described how potatoes could be a win for athletes. "Potatoes can help restore electrolyte balance," she said. "Sodium and potassium, which are found in potato peels, are two important electrolytes, and athletes lose them in sweat." Electrolytes are necessary for optimum body function, and having too few can cause cramps, as many athletes know.\xa0Skin careAccording to Organic Facts, vitamin C, vitamin B6, potassium, magnesium, zinc and phosphorous can all help keep skin as smooth and creamy as, well, mashed potatoes. These nutrients are all present in potatoes.Cancer riskA 2017 study published by the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry found that consuming purple potatoes might reduce the risk of colon cancer. Purple potatoes are high in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce levels of interleukin-6 or IL-6, a protein linked to cancer cell growth within the colon. The study looked at groups of pigs on three different diets, one of which was supplemented with purple potatoes. At the end of the study, pigs that ate purple potatoes had levels of IL-6 six times lower than the other groups. While the study has not yet been replicated on humans, researchers anticipate that the results will transfer because a pig’s digestive system is similar to a human’s.\xa0 Health risksIn 2017, an Australian man named Andrew Flinders Taylor appeared in the headlines for having eaten almost nothing but potatoes for a year and losing around 110 lbs., according to Australian Popular Science. This sparked public interest in the potato diet. Dieticians, however, do not recommend such a diet because it is almost impossible to get all 20 essential amino acids and 30 vitamins and minerals from one food. A mix of white and sweet potatoes would, however, get you closer than most foods. Nevertheless, your health would suffer from eating nothing but potatoes, said Jarzabkowski.Blood sugarPotatoes are fat free, but they are also starchy carbohydrates with little protein. According to Harvard, the carbs in potatoes are the kind that the body digests rapidly and have a high glycemic load (or glycemic index). That is, they cause blood sugar and insulin to surge and then dip. This effect can make people feel hungry again soon after eating, which may lead to overeating. The rapid rise in blood sugar can also lead to increased insulin production. Jarzabkowski said, "The last thing I\'d recommend to a diabetic is a potato."On the other hand, potatoes are also a great source of fiber, Jarzabkowski said, and the fiber content helps you feel fuller longer.\xa0Furthermore, a 2016 study in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that different individuals respond to a food’s glycemic index value in substantially different ways. Therefore, suggested the study, the glycemic index is limited in its usefulness in terms of recommending food choices.\xa0CarbsJarzabkowski recommended that when planning meals, people should remember potatoes\' carb content. "Potatoes should take the place of a grain on the plate. Use it as a carb rather than as your only vegetable," she said.\xa0Even when prepared in a healthy way, potatoes can present health problems to individuals with obesity or diabetes. They are high in simple carbohydrates, which can lead to weight gain. Jarzabkowski likened the vegetables in this way to white bread.\xa0The Harvard School of Public Health tracked the diet and lifestyle of 120,000 men and women for about 20 years and found that people who increased their consumption of French fries and baked or mashed potatoes gained more weight over time — as much as 3.4 lbs. every four years.\xa0A 2016 study published in The BMJ looked at a large cohort of women and found that those who ate four or more servings of potatoes a week had a higher risk of blood pressure compared to women who ate potatoes less than once a month. The risk held for women who ate baked, boiled, mashed or fried potatoes and for men who ate fried potatoes. Men who ate the equivalent amount of potato chips, however, did not see their risk for higher blood pressure increase. This study further indicates that potatoes may contribute to different health outcomes in different people, perhaps depending on their unique glycemic index reactions. It also emphasizes the importance of potato preparation.\xa0Healthiest ways to cook potatoesYou can probably guess that smothering your potato in sour cream and bacon isn\'t the healthiest way to enjoy it, but what is? Which is more nutritious — baked, boiled or steamed potatoes?Jarzabkowski emphasized the importance of preparation in potato consumption. "The best way to eat a potato is in its whole, unprocessed form," she said. Baking a potato is the best way to prepare it, as baking, or microwaving, a potato causes the lowest amount of nutrients to be lost, she said.\xa0The next-healthiest way to cook a potato is through steaming, which causes less nutrient loss than boiling. Cooking a peeled potato in this way results in significant nutrient loss, as the water-soluble nutrients leach out into the water.In a potato, those water-soluble nutrients include B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, potassium and calcium. As much as 80 percent of a potato\'s vitamin C may go down the drain if you boil the vegetable. The same thing can happen with peeled potatoes that are left to soak, a method used to stop darkening. If you use the water from the potato boil as stock, however, you\'ll still get some of the nutrients.However you cook a potato, try to eat the skin. Ounce for ounce, the skin contains more nutrients — including the majority of the vegetable\'s fiber — than the rest of the potato, Jarzabkowski said. Are potato eyes poisonous?If the eyes of a potato are not sprouting, they can be eaten. If they are sprouting, the National Institutes of Health recommends cutting off the eyes and their sprouts before eating the potato.\xa0Potato stems, branches, leaves and fruits are toxic, containing alkaloids such as arsenic, chaconine and solanine. Solanine is "very toxic even in small amounts," according to the NIH.Poison is also found in green potatoes. The vegetables turn green if they have had too much exposure to light. According to the NIH, you should "never eat potatoes that are spoiled or green below the skin." Other spud factsHere are some potato facts, from the U.S. Potato Board and the Idaho Potato Museum:The word "potato" comes from the Spanish "patata." The nickname "spud" comes from the digging tool used in planting potatoes: "espada" in Spanish, "spyd" in Dutch and "spade" in English. The word eventually became associated with the potato itself.\xa0It is a myth that the word “spud” is an acronym for the Society for the Prevention of an Unwholesome Diet, a supposed activist group that wanted to keep the potato out of Britain in the 19th century.Potatoes are members of the nightshade family, like tomatoes, eggplants and peppers.\xa0They are not root vegetables; potatoes are actually the swollen part of the stem of the perennial Solanum tuberosum. This part of the plant is called a tuber, which functions to provide food to the leafy part of the plant.\xa0The "eyes" of potatoes are buds, which will sprout into branches if left alone.There are thousands of potato varieties, but not all are commercially available. Popular varieties include Russet, red, white, yellow, purple/blue, fingerling and petite.Idaho, whose license plates bear the slogan “Famous Potatoes,” is the top potato-producing state, but spuds are grown in all 50 U.S. states. Following Idaho are Washington, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Oregon, Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, Maine and California.In 2013, there were more than 1 million acres of potatoes planted and harvested, which produced 43.7 billion lbs. (20 billion kg) of the vegetable.The average American eats about 124 lbs. (56 kg) of potatoes per year; Germans eat about twice as much.Potatoes were traditionally used to make vodka, although today most vodka is produced using fermented grains such as corn, wheat or rye.According to Guinness World Records, the largest potato grown was 7 lbs., 1 ounce (3.2 kg).The Inca in Peru were the first to cultivate potatoes, growing the vegetables around 8000 B.C. to 5000 B.C.In 1536, Spanish Conquistadors conquered Peru, and carried potatoes back to Europe.Sir Walter Raleigh introduced potatoes to Ireland in 1589. It took nearly four decades for the potato to spread to the rest of Europe. Because potatoes were not mentioned in the Bible, many people looked at them with suspicion. For many years, people thought that eating potatoes would cause leprosy.Potatoes arrived in the British colonies in 1621 when the governor of Bermuda, Nathaniel Butler, sent two large cedar chests containing potatoes and other vegetables to Gov. Francis Wyatt at Jamestown.Scotch-Irish immigrants planted the first permanent potato patches in North America in 1719, near Londonderry, New Hampshire.\xa0A royal chef named A. Parmentier helped King Louis XIV popularize the potato in France in the 18th century. He created a feast with only potato dishes, which he realized was possible when he was fed only potatoes while imprisoned in Germany. Benjamin Franklin, ambassador to France, was in attendance at Parmentier\'s feast in 1767.Marie Antoinette turned potatoes into a fashion statement when she paraded through the French countryside wearing potato blossoms in her hair.French fries were introduced to the United States by Thomas Jefferson, who served them in the White House during his presidency (1801-1809).Another royal chef, Collinet, chef for French King Louis Phillippe, unintentionally created soufflés, or puffed potatoes, one night in the mid-1800s. When the king arrived late for dinner, Collinet plunged already-fried potatoes into extremely hot oil to reheat them. To the chef\'s surprise and the king\'s delight, the potatoes puffed up like little balloons.The Irish Potato Famine: In the 1840s, an outbreak of potato blight swept through Europe and wiped out the potato crop in many countries. The Irish working class lived largely on potatoes, and when the blight reached Ireland, the residents\' main staple food disappeared. Many poverty-stricken families struggled to survive. Over the course of the famine, almost 1 million people died from starvation or disease. Another million left Ireland, mostly for Canada and the United States.In 1853, railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt complained that his potatoes were cut too thick and sent them back to the kitchen at a resort in Saratoga Springs, New York. To spite him, the chef, George Crum, sliced some potatoes paper thin, fried them in hot oil, salted and served them. To everyone\'s surprise, Vanderbilt loved his "Saratoga Crunch Chips," and the potato chip was born.The potato was the first vegetable to be grown in space. In October 1995, NASA and the University of Wisconsin created the technology to do so with the goal of feeding astronauts on long space voyages.Additional resourcesSmithsonian magazine: How the Potato Changed the WorldThe World’s Healthiest Foods: PotatoesCleveland Clinic: White Potatoes vs. Sweet Potatoes: Which Are Healthier?If you read this article, you should be able to score well on our quiz.Quiz: Tater Test\nSign Up for e-mail newsletters\nStay up to date on the coronavirus outbreak by signing up to our newsletter today.\nThank you for signing up to Live Science.

Here\'s why that\'s bad.\nBy\nNicoletta Lanese - Staff Writer\n21 May 2020\nShares\nComments (0)\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and several state health departments have been reporting COVID-19 diagnostic tests and antibody tests as one grand tally, rather than keeping their results separate, The Atlantic reported.\xa0Reporting these numbers as a lump sum, rather than two distinct data points, presents several major issues.\xa0Namely, combining the numbers could make America\'s diagnostic testing capabilities and testing rates appear higher than they actually are, according to The Atlantic. And as the tests serve profoundly different purposes, "positive" results from either test cannot be interpreted in the same way. Reporting all the positive results together, as one number, could skew our understanding of how many new COVID-19 cases emerge over time — a crucial metric to help control outbreaks as states begin reopening.Related: 11 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across speciesWhen told how the CDC chose to lump the results of both tests together, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute Ashish Jha told The Atlantic, "You\'ve got to be kidding me ... How could the CDC make that mistake? This is a mess."Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 work by detecting viral genetic material in nasal swabs, throat swabs and saliva samples collected from patients, Live Science previously reported. The tests, although not 100% accurate, can reveal whether a given patient has an active COVID-19 infection right now, at the time of testing. New, saliva-based tests appear to be more reliable than the swab-based tests, in terms of minimizing false results.\xa0Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose an active COVID-19 infection; rather, the tests scan patient blood samples for evidence of past infections. During infection, the body mounts an immune response against the virus by building specific antibodies — molecules that latch onto the virus and help neutralize it, Live Science previously reported. A positive antibody test result would indicate that the person has already been exposed to the virus and likely already recovered from an infection. If a person tests negative on an antibody test, they could still have an active COVID-19 infection, as their body has yet to build up enough specific antibodies to be detected by the tests.A positive antibody test result may also indicate that the individual is now somewhat immune to the pathogen; however, more reliable antibody tests and more clinical data are needed to know if a positive antibody test actually implies immunity and how long that immunity might last.\xa0"The viral [diagnostic] testing is to understand how many people are getting infected, while antibody testing is like looking in the rearview mirror," Jha told The Atlantic. "The two tests are totally different signals."\xa0Combining these two signals makes the data difficult to interpret and could be misleading to the public, because the combined number does not reflect the rate of new infection (and the number of infectious people circulating) in their region, William Hanage, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told The Atlantic. "Combining a test that is designed to detect current infection with a test that detects infection at some point in the past is just really confusing and muddies the water," he said.In addition, people are most likely to receive a diagnostic test if they\'re suspected to be infected, meaning they\'re showing symptoms of the disease or have been in contact with an infected person. Antibody tests can be given to anyone, and because relatively few people are thought to have been infected with COVID-19 across the U.S., many antibody tests may come back negative. If combined with diagnostic test results, antibody test results could artificially lower the percentage of positive tests out of the total.\xa0The percentage of positive diagnostic tests provides a sense of how much virus is currently circulating in a community, and if skewed, that warped statistic could wrongly influence public health policy decisions.\xa0In addition to the CDC, Pennsylvania, Texas, Georgia and Vermont also report their diagnostic and antibody test results as one grand total, according to The Atlantic. Virginia and Maine previously blended their data, as well, but they have started reporting the numbers separately within the past week.\xa0According to The Atlantic\'s COVID Tracking Project, COVID-19 testing capacity in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past month, increasing from about 147,000 tests a day in mid-April to more than 413,000 tests a day as of May 20. Simultaneously, the proportion of positive tests recorded each week fell from 10% to 6% of total tests conducted. Both trends appear encouraging at face value, but given that diagnostic and antibody tests are sometimes being lumped together, it\'s impossible to know whether the data reflects reality, The Atlantic reported.\xa0When asked about the mess-up, CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said that the agency "hopes" to separate the data on their COVID Data Tracker within the next few weeks.\xa0Going viral: 6 new findings about viruses\xa0\xa0The 12 deadliest viruses on Earth\xa0\xa0Top 10 mysterious diseases\xa0Originally published on Live Science.\nOFFER: Save 45% on \'How It Works\' \'All About Space\' and \'All About History\'!\nFor a limited time, you can take out a digital subscription to any of our best-selling science magazines for just $2.38 per month, or 45% off the standard price for the first three months.View Deal\nSee all comments (0)\nNo comments yet\nComment from the forums\nSign Up for e-mail newsletters\nStay up to date on the coronavirus outbreak by signing up to our newsletter today.\nThank you for signing up to Live Science.

Experts have mixed answers.\nBy\nStephanie Pappas - Live Science Contributor\n02 June 2020\nTwo studies come to different conclusions.\nShares\nComments (18)\nHomemade face masks contain the coronavirus only a little.\n(Image: © Shutterstock)\nEditor\'s Note (June 2 at 11:30 a.m.): A paper discussed below has been retracted by the journal the Annals of Internal Medicine.\xa0The authors wrote\xa0that their statistical methods could not determine whether the findings were reliable, making the results of the small study "uninterpretable." The study had found that surgical and cotton masks do not effectively contain viral droplets containing SARS-CoV-2.\xa0Subsequent research\xa0has suggested that face masks are an effective method for containing the spread of the virus, used along with staying six feet apart from other people.For the first time, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that even seemingly healthy people wear masks over their mouths and noses when venturing out of their homes into places where it is difficult to maintain distance from other people. But there is still major debate over how much masks — particularly the homemade fabric masks that the CDC recommends for the public — can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Researchers, writing in two new papers, attempt to tackle the efficacy of masks, one more rigorously than the other, and come to differing conclusions. One study examined the effect of masks on seasonal coronaviruses (which cause many cases of the common cold) and found that surgical masks are helpful at reducing how much virus a sick person spreads. The other looked particularly at SARS-CoV-2 and found no effect of either surgical or fabric masks on reducing virus spread, but only had four participants and used a crude measure of viral spread.The bottom line, experts say, is that masks might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly passing along the virus. But the evidence for the efficacy of surgical or homemade masks is limited, and masks aren\'t the most important protection against the coronavirus.Related: 13 Coronavirus myths busted by science"Putting a face mask on does not mean that you stop the other practices," said May Chu, a clinical professor in epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health on the Anschutz Medical Campus who was not involved in either new study. "It does not mean you get closer to people, it does not mean you don\'t have to wash your hands as often and you can touch your face. All of that still is in place, this is just an add-on."Face mask basicsRecommendations about masks can easily get confusing, because all masks are not made equal. The N95 mask effectively prevents viral spread. These masks, when properly fitted, seal closely to the face and filter out 95% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. But N95 masks are in serious shortage even for medical professionals, who are exposed to the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 and are most in need of the strongest protection against the virus. They\'re also difficult to fit correctly. For those reasons, the CDC does not recommend them for general use.Related: How are people being infected with COVID-19?Due to shortages, the CDC also does not recommend surgical masks for the general public. These masks don\'t seal against the face but do include non-woven polypropylene layers that are moisture resistant. In a surgical mask, about 70% of the outside air moves through the mask and about 30% travels around the sides, Chu told Live Science. For that reason, they don\'t offer as much protection as N95s.That leaves fabric masks, which currently are recommended for general use by the CDC. Fabric masks also allow air in around the sides, but lack non-woven, moisture-repelling layers. They impede only about 2% of airflow in, Chu said.All of this leakage in surgical and fabric masks are why public health officials generally don\'t believe that wearing a mask prevents anyone from catching a virus that is already floating around in the environment. Airflow follows the path of least resistance, said Rachael Jones, an associate professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who was not involved in the new research. If viral particles are nearby, they have an easy path around a surgical or fabric mask. And in the case of a fabric mask, wearers may well be wafting in particles small enough to flow right through the fabric.But what about the other way around? When the wearer of a mask coughs or sneezes, the barrier might be enough to contain a lot of that initial jet of grossness — even if there are gaps in the fabric or around the sides. That\'s what the new mask studies aimed to address: Whether surgical or fabric masks did a good job of containing viruses.Efficacy of face masksCoronavirus science and news—Coronavirus in the US: Map & cases\n—What are coronavirus symptoms?\n—How deadly is the new coronavirus?\n—How long does coronavirus last on surfaces?\n—Is there a cure for COVID-19?\n—How does coronavirus compare with seasonal flu?\n—Can people spread the coronavirus after they recover?One study, published April 6 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found that they did not. That study, led by South Korean researchers, involved asking four patients with COVID-19 to cough into a petri dish 7.8 inches (20 centimeters) away. The patients coughed without masks, while wearing a disposable surgical mask and again wearing a 100% cotton mask.Neither mask meaningfully decreased the viral load coughed onto the petri dishes. But experts not involved in the study who were contacted by Live Science were hesitant to put much stock into the findings. The researchers didn\'t look at distances beyond 7.8 inches to see if droplets didn\'t travel as far while people were wearing masks, Chu said."They didn\'t measure 2 feet or 3 feet or 4 feet," she said.Related: Is 6 feet enough space for social distancing?The study also returned the odd result that most swabs from the outside of patient masks were positive for coronavirus and most from the inside were negative. The authors speculate that perhaps turbulent jets of air from coughing carried the virus toward the outside of the mask, but the explanation wasn\'t very satisfying, according to Jones.The other study, published April 3 in the journal Nature Medicine, used a more sophisticated method of collecting the virus particles that sick people emit. The researchers asked 426 volunteers to breathe for 30 minutes into a cone-like device that captures everything exhaled. Of these, 43 patients had influenza, 54 patients had rhinoviruses and 17 patients had seasonal coronaviruses (the kinds that cause colds, not the kind that causes COVID-19). This method allowed the researchers to quantify how much virus was found in droplet particles, which are greater than 0.0002 inches (5 microns) in diameter, versus aerosol particles, which are 5 microns or smaller. The participants were randomized to either wear a surgical mask or not wear a mask during the study.The first key finding was that the researchers detected virus in tiny aerosol particles in all cases: influenza, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. In the case of influenza, they cultured the captured particles and discovered that they were infectious. That\'s important, said study author Ben Cowling, head of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at The Hong Kong University, because there is a long-running debate among health professionals about whether influenza can spread via aerosols. The study suggests that it likely can, and that colds probably can too."For seasonal coronavirus and rhinovirus, we didn\'t attempt to culture the virus in the aerosols, but there is no reason to believe that the virus would not be infectious," Cowling told Live Science.Related: COVID-19 may spread through breathing and talkingAnd as for masks? Surgical masks reduced the amount of virus released from a sick person in the form of droplets but not aerosols for influenza; the masks reduced coronavirus in both droplets and aerosols; and they didn\'t reduce either in rhinovirus. For the seasonal coronavirus, researchers found the virus in droplets in 3 out of 10 samples from participants not wearing masks and in aerosols in 4 out of 10 samples taken without masks. In samples taken with masks, no virus was detected in either droplets or aerosols.The difference between viruses could have something to do with where in the respiratory tract these infectious invaders make their homes, said Cowling, who is also co-director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control. For example, a virus that reproduces deep in the lungs might need to travel in smaller particles to make it all the way out into the world, while one that reproduces mostly in the nose and throat may be more easily mobilized in bigger droplets.The results from influenza and seasonal coronaviruses suggest that surgical masks can help keep people with COVID-19 from spreading the virus, Cowling said. SARS-CoV-2 probably behaves similarly to the viruses he and his team studied, he said, and the fact that people can spread the virus before they experience symptoms is an argument for recommending masks for everyone.But experts are still mixed on the potential usefulness of non-N95 masks."To me, it\'s not harmful to wear these masks, but it doesn\'t look from this study like there is a whole lot of benefit," Jones said. The sample size for seasonal coronavirus was small, she said, and there was a large amount of non-mask-related variation in how much virus people emitted, particularly given that the majority of samples without masks didn\'t have detectable coronavirus.One thing everyone does agree on is that, whatever containment provided by non-fitted masks do provide, homemade fabric masks are the least effective. The recommendations that everyone wear masks are because "any kind of impediment is better than nothing," Chu said. But fabric masks are not expected to be as protective as surgical masks, she said. That\'s why public health officials are warning people to remain at least 6 feet apart from one another, even if they are wearing masks. In other words, homemade masks are likely to be just a small piece of the puzzle for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic."There\'s been enough research done to be able to confidently say that masks wouldn\'t be able to stop the spread of infection, that they would only have a small effect on transmission," Cowling said.

Yes, there, I said it. These articles ALWAYS involve quotes from epidemiologists. Seriously, does anyone know what epidemiologist do? The study the trends of various disease processes. They don\'t really know anything about respiratory protection. Frankly, I\'m tired of hearing from a person who can\'t explain the difference between a P-100 and an N-95 and the classification process. And even the researchers who just did a study on masks and SARS CoV-2 FAILED to examine N-95 masks. These people have no clue what respiratory protection involves and how to achieve it. Now, if you get an engineer who works for NIOSH, I would be interested in hearing from them.\nReply\nx_artifex\n23 April 2020 11:59\nWhy do all these articles on masks think the medical N95 is the only proper respirator on Earth? There are many other respirators that can protect you from COVID-19. Standard non-medical respirators filter out just as well - N95, P95, P100, N100\'s and so on. Disposable versions or filters for reusable respirators like the 3M 7500 or GVS Elipse. I\'ve been wearing my GVS in public with P100 filters and this provides better protection than an N95.\nHow is it I\'m just an air brush artist but I know more about respirators than these epidemiologists and journalists?\nReply\nx_artifex\n23 April 2020 12:01\nHow incredibly unhelpful these epidemiologists and journalists are. There are people on the internet that have figured out how to make homemade masks using HEPA filters, that properly fit and work just as good as an N95. But does anyone report on that? Nope. Do these epidemiologists study it? Nope.\nReply\nferrencebeeb\n05 May 2020 16:15\nThis whole debate is so frustrating.\nThe closing point, "We shouldn\'t be relying on masks to help us go back to normal."\nNo-one is suggesting that we should!!! Why is this point used when journalists summarise reasons not to wear masks?\nIt\'s the same when people say that wearing a mask can actually increase your risk because people touch the front of the mask when removing it, or people stop doing other measures such as social distancing. Of course we have to educate everyone on how to wear a mask in a way that won\'t reduce the benefits or even increase risk, but we don\'t just assume that the general public are too irresponsible to be trusted to wear masks properly. At least, if we are going to assume that, then shouldn\'t that assumption be based on rigorous scientific tests also?\nIn the 1st piece of research, "The researchers didn\'t look at distances beyond 7.8 inches to see if droplets didn\'t travel as far while people were wearing masks, Chu said."\nThat is ridiculous! Hasn\'t it been proven that when you cough, droplets or aerosols can travel up to 6 feet? So why would you only test to 7.8 inches?\nThen the 2nd piece of research. I don\'t see how anyone could conclude from this that "it doesn\'t look from this study like there is a whole lot of benefit".\nThe research showed that wearing mask reduced coronavirus droplets & aerosols from 3 or 4 out of 10 to zero respectively! How is that not beneficial?!True the sample size is small (17) but that doesn\'t mean you can conclude that masks are not of much benefit. It just means they could be.\nAnd the point saying, "there was a large amount of non-mask-related variation in how much virus people emitted". That is completely irrelevant to the argument!\nLet\'s just say there is insufficient evidence on mask wearing for science to say with certainty that wearing masks is beneficial.\nIsn\'t there also insufficient evidence to say that not wearing a mask is beneficial?\nYou can choose to wear a mask, or you can choose to not wear a mask.\nThe lack of evidence on this does not mean we should default to not wearing masks. It just means we have a to make a choice without using science.\nAnd when science can\'t provide an answer to which option to choose, surely we have to then rely on COMMON SENSE!\nReply\nEric Post\n10 May 2020 07:46\nYou don\'t have to be a genius to realize, all cloth masks do is give politician something for the general public to pin hopes on, while their is a shortage of masks that can actually help.

It\'s a "feel good" measure only.Exactly. And the homemade masks just muffle people\'s voices and you can\'t hear them. Guess what people do when that happens? They lean closer. Was at a checkout last week and the cashier said something and I couldn\'t understand her. What happened was that both of us leaned closer so I could hear, she around the plexiglass barrier. These steps are all pointless and give a false sense of security. And who, I wonder, is going to pay for all those filters to fit into washable masks? No, we need to get back to normal - and normal does not include any masks.\nReply\nJane Pristly\n16 May 2020 17:38\nThis is a bafflingly silly piece and it\'s a bit surprising that this is on "Live Science". None of these woefully incomplete studies prove anything conclusive.\nMeanwhile:\nHighly densely populated cities like Hong kong and Taipei have single digit fatalities despite no real lockdown. Everyone wears masks.\nNew York has similar population as HK, and lower than Taipei. It has an incredibly large outbreak. Sure, the governments started their precautions late, but people still don\'t wear masks. CDC and FDA are still dithering on the matter, although CDC\'s website now, finally, in May, has a clear dictat: "wear masks".\nWhere\'s the study that speaks of viral load? If two people are wearing masks, even if the droplets do transmit, will the viral load not be substantially lower? Low viral load means milder Covid, which is highly desirable.\nThis entire analysis is missing, and even the likes of "ReutersFact check" and snopes are relying on this "Expert" advice to convey wrong info to people. Some of these people are commenting here and there\'s no doubt they\'re from countries that have high fatality tolls.\nReply\nJane Pristly\n16 May 2020 17:40\n4TimesAYear said: No, we need to get back to normal - and normal does not include any masks.\nThis is the most misguided comment you can make. I\'m all for sensible reopening of the economy (with the vulnerable still quarantined to the extent they can be), but countries that have in fact worn masks have registered staggeringly positive outcomes.\nHong Kong or Taipei are densely populated and they have *single digit* fatalities. Why? Everyone wears masks, and wears them seriously and sensibly. Lockdowns won\'t do diddly if people get back to "normal" as you suggest. It\'ll just delay the inevitable.\nMasks are absolutely vital to keeping transmissions low. Even if they don\'t completely prevent droplet transfer, they unequivocally lower the viral load. Low viral load means a milder infection, which is highly desirable.\nReply\n4TimesAYear\n17 May 2020 10:23\nThe corona virus goes straight through homemade fabric masks. If the mask cannot prevent me from getting sick, I fail to see how it\'s going to prevent others from getting sick. Btw, before this, the reason people wore them in China, etc. was due to pollution, not for disease prevention.\nI\'m a realist. Like Bill Maher says, you can\'t sanitize the universe. Pathogens are everywhere. Masks can\'t be the new normal. Neither can sanitizing everything. One young man, wise beyond his years, asked a colleague in Walmart the other day, "What are all these chemicals doing to us?" the answer to defeating COVID, again, like Bill Maher said, is a strong immune system. Lockdowns don\'t "do diddly", period. They kept track of the numbers in New York. Guess where the majority of hospitalizations (66%) were coming from? Those who were sheltering in place. Those that remained the healthiest were those that were allowed to keep working. All conventional "wisdom" was wrong.\nReply\nOkegnis\n17 May 2020 10:42\nThough mask has it own benefit when compared with the population that does not wear it .\nMy question now is "why can\'t our expect look at the likely hood of getting the virus through the other portal of entry like the ear, anus and ultimately the eyes?"Because I read a report claiming that it\'s possible to get it through the eyes .\nBut does mask cover the eyes?\nReply\nView All 18 Comments\nShow more comments\nSign Up for e-mail newsletters\nStay up to date on the coronavirus outbreak by signing up to our newsletter today.\nThank you for signing up to Live Science.

Danilychev gathered the COVID-19 numbers from Worldometers.info.\xa0Related: Latest COVID-19 news and US case countsCOVID-19\'s grim new position is happening as several states, including New York, New Jersey and Michigan, are hitting what may be their peaks. Last week, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the country, with 1,051 deaths on April 3, Danilychev noted.Danilychev\'s animation, which shows the top 15 causes of death in the United States, can be seen here. Of note, the COVID-19 data shows actual U.S. deaths, while the other causes of death are extrapolated daily averages from 2018.\xa0This analysis makes sense, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, who wasn\'t involved with the project.\xa0COVID-19 may have also altered death rates in more indirect ways, Schaffner said."One of the things that\'s dropped off the list is trauma deaths, because people are not out banging into each other with their automobiles and things such as that," he said. It wouldn\'t be surprising if COVID-19 was a top killer in other developed countries, too, as these nations hit their peaks, including in Italy and Spain, "both countries that were very hard hit and are now leveling off," Schaffner told Live Science.The only other modern outbreak in developed countries that affected death rates so dramatically is HIV, which causes AIDS, Schaffner said. "It became, for a period of time, one of the leading causes of deaths for young adults before it was controlled with treatment," he said.\xa0However, it appears that measures taken to control COVID-19, such as sheltering at home and social distancing, are working.\xa0"We\'re actually, in many parts of the country now, starting to turn this virus down," Schaffner said. "It\'s happening in the state of Washington and California. Even New York City thinks they may see a downturn."As of today (April 10), the U.S. has diagnosed 495,750 COVID-19 cases and experienced 18,430 deaths, according to worldometers.info. But there is a bright spot; 26,783 people have recovered thus far, and experts expect that number to grow.\xa013 coronavirus myths busted by science12 deadliest viruses on Earth11 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across speciesOriginally published on Live Science.\nOFFER: Save 45% on \'How It Works\' \'All About Space\' and \'All About History\'!\nFor a limited time, you can take out a digital subscription to any of our best-selling science magazines for just $2.38 per month, or 45% off the standard price for the first three months.View Deal\nSee all comments (22)\n22 Comments\nComment from the forums\nstentor\n11 April 2020 12:28\nThe CDC disagrees, according to a CNN article from the same day as this article.\nReply\nThe Admiral\n11 April 2020 16:49\nYep... complete horse s***.\nBut then... that\'s the narrative... and the only solution is to curl up in a ball, capitulate to authority, and hide in your home... because the only treatment option available is being demonized because 1 out of 2000 people who use it might have a reaction... and also\n...VACCINES TO SAVE THE DAY!!!\nHey... we don\'t have one... and no one has yet managed to make one that works for the coronavirus family of pathogens... but VACCINES!!!!\nThere\'s billionaires in a number of places rubbing their greedy hands together thinking about all the money and control they are garnering here.\nReply\nJohn M\n11 April 2020 18:59\nOf course, CV19 will surpass cancer.

Laura Geggel, you need to be terminated from any position related to reporting immediately, heck resign, recuse yourself indefinitely, you ARE part of the problem and should walk around with your head down in shame for falsely reporting such things.\nReply\nJames DeMeo\n12 April 2020 19:07\nFALSE AND MISLEADING. CDC just announced a few days ago that anyone even "suspected" of being a Covid19 patient gets that put on their death certificate. No testing is required. So a person with flu, pneumonia, heart attack, cancer death, you name it, is open to be listed as a Covid19 death. And hence, the numbers of Covid19 deaths are artifically boosted up, even the AMA is recommending this procedure, and hosptials are happly also because medicare payments are increased by around $13,000 merely for an identification of Covid19. Three times as much is given if the person is put on a deadly ventillator, which is no small measure, very traumatic and probably kills a lot of people upon whom it is demanded. These procedures and data-rule changes were instituted without scientific justifications, apparently to jazz up the Covid19 numbers in agreement with the Big Push for mandatory vaccinations being rushed into production. Disreputable characters like Bill Gates and Dr. Anthony Fauci want to lord over the American public like Grand Inquisitors, with mandatory vaccines and rf-id chips that inform who got the vaccine and who not -- and from there, the public will be segregated, with vaccine-dissenters treated like leppers, refused entry to public events and spaces, like the Chinese communists. Fauci says, even returning back to "normal" will not happen, that forever more we must distance ourselves, wear face masks, not shake hands, etc. The guy is a neurotic germophobe and medical totalitarian. So many problems and deceptions going on, the CDC and medical establishment cannot be trusted anymore, and now also it appears, neither can Space.com.

The radioactive spike suggests damage to a nuclear fuel element, the Associated Press reported.However, the Russian nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom has denied problems related to facilities in Kola and Leningrad, the two nuclear plants operating in the region, according to TASS, a Russian news agency, as reported by the AP.Related: 5 weird things you didn\'t know about Chernobyl22 /23 June 2020, RN #IMS station SEP63 #Sweden🇸🇪 detected 3isotopes; Cs-134, Cs-137 & Ru-103 associated w/Nuclear fission @ higher[ ] than usual levels (but not harmful for human health). The possible source region in the 72h preceding detection is shown in orange on the map. pic.twitter.com/ZeGsJa21TNJune 26, 2020Several Scandinavian watchdog agencies detected the elevated levels of the radionuclides (or radioactive isotopes). Radionuclides are atoms whose nuclei are unstable; the excess energy inside the nucleus gets released through radioactive decay. In particular, concentrations of the radionuclides cesium-134, cesium-137 and ruthenium-103 rose in parts of Finland, southern Scandinavia and the Arctic, Lassina Zerbo, the Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, wrote on Twitter. Though these pose no harm to humans, they are byproducts of nuclear fission, Zerbo wrote.\xa0"The radionuclides are artificial, that is to say they are man-made. The composition of the nuclides may indicate damage to a fuel element in a nuclear power plant," an official with the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, which analyzed the isotope data, said on Friday (June 26).Because so few measurements have been taken, monitoring agencies weren\'t able to identify a specific source, NIPHE officials said.The sudden radioactivity spike echoes the events following the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown, the biggest nuclear disaster in history. Within a few days of the 1986 disaster, a Swedish nuclear power plant detected elevated radioactivity levels, according to an account from the European parliament.In recent years, another radioactive mystery cloud wafting over Europe was tied to Russia. In 2017, a plume holding 1,000 times the normal levels of ruthenium-106 was detected over Europe, The Washington Post reported. Russia denied any involvement, though a nuclear reprocessing plant in Russia was a strong suspect, according to a 2019 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.5 everyday things that are radioactiveImages: Chernobyl, frozen in timeStunning images of Russia from aboveOriginally published on Live Science.\nOFFER: Save 45% on \'How It Works\' \'All About Space\' and \'All About History\'!\nFor a limited time, you can take out a digital subscription to any of our best-selling science magazines for just $2.38 per month, or 45% off the standard price for the first three months.View Deal\nSee all comments (3)\n3 Comments\nComment from the forums\nDanP\n29 June 2020 14:08\nChernobyl is not in Russia, but Ukraine, which were both in USSR at the time.\nReply\ntexasdawn1\n30 June 2020 03:54\nNo one is disputing where Chernobyl is located; not sure what you are trying to relay here??\nReply\nHayseed\n30 June 2020 04:52\nThey probably dropped another missile.\nReply\nView All 3 Comments\nSign Up for e-mail newsletters\nStay up to date on the coronavirus outbreak by signing up to our newsletter today.\nThank you for signing up to Live Science.

Here\'s what he looked like.\nBy\nLaura Geggel - Associate Editor\n25 June 2020\nShares\nComments (0)\n(Image: © Oscar Nilsson)\nWe may never know why the skull of a Stone Age man ended up on a stake in a mysterious underwater grave 8,000 years ago, but thanks to a new facial reconstruction, we can see what he probably looked like before he died.Archaeologists discovered the man\'s skull, as well as the remains of at least 10 other Stone Age adults and an infant, in 2012 at the bottom of what used to be a small lake in what is now Motala, a municipality in eastern-central Sweden. However, only one of the adults had a jaw; the rest were jawless, and two of the skulls had been placed on stakes sticking out from the lake\'s surface.Now, a 3D facial reconstruction reveals the likeness of one of those jawless skulls. Oscar Nilsson, a forensic artist based in Sweden, used this skull as well as genetic and anatomical information gleaned from it to create a bust of the man — a blue-eyed, brown-haired and pale-skinned individual in his 50s.\xa0Related: Stone Age man, whose skull was found on a spike, gets facial recreation (photos)Nilsson didn\'t want to damage the ancient skull, so he took a CT (computed tomography) scan of the specimen and used that data to print a 3D replica of it in vinyl plastic. From there, Nilsson determined how thick to make the man\'s facial muscles and skin based on forensic methods that focus on factors such as the man\'s weight, height and ethnicity. For instance, this man was from a group of hunters and gatherers whose genetic heritage included people who came to Scandinavia from the north and east, as well as from the south about 2,000 years earlier, Nilsson said."However, in this case, there was no jaw," Nilsson told Live Science in an email. "So, the first thing to reconstruct was his jaw," which he did by taking skull measurements.\xa0In this reconstruction, the Mesolithic man, who died in his 50s, wears a wild boar skin. (Image credit: Oscar Nilsson)Almost all the adults in the grave had no jawbones. But the Middle Stone Age, or Mesolithic, grave contained the jawbones of wild animals, including those of brown bears, wild boars, red deer, moose and roe deer, according to a 2018 study on the site, published in the journal Antiquity.\xa0This detail inspired Nilsson\'s choices for the man\'s wardrobe and haircut."He wears the skin from a wild boar," Nilsson said. "We can see from how the human skulls and animal jaws were found that they clearly meant a big deal in their cultural and religious beliefs."\xa0Moreover, the man has short hair in the reconstruction — "his hairdresser in his time must have used a sharp flint tool for this," Nilsson said — and the man has "a wisp of hair at the back of his head, like a pig\'s tail."This short hairstyle lets viewers see a vicious wound — a 1-inch-long (2.5 centimeters) injury on the top of the man\'s head.This head wound, however, didn\'t kill the man — at least not right away. His head injury, as well as the head wounds found on the other individuals in the water burial, showed signs of healing, archaeologists found. In fact, Nilsson added scar tissue on the wound, said study co-lead researcher Fredrik Hallgren, an archaeologist at the Cultural Heritage Foundation in Västerås, Sweden."Somebody gave them love and care after this [trauma] and healed them back to life again," Hallgren told Live Science when the 2018 study on the burial first came out.\xa0Related: Stone Age skulls found on wooden stakes (photos)Meanwhile, the white chalk decorating the man\'s chest is a piece of artistic license, based on the fact that many Indigenous groups today use chalk for body paint, Nilsson said. "It\'s a reminder we cannot understand their aesthetic taste, just observe it," he said. "We have no reason to believe these people were less interested in their looks, and to express their individuality, than we are today."Like many of Nilsson\'s other creations, including an ancient Wari queen whose remains were found in Peru and an 18-year-old Stone Age woman from Greece, this Mesolithic man looks pensive.\xa0"He is clearly observing something, like a guard or a hunter," Nilsson said. "Can he see us? If so, he would be just as surprised as we are. Almost 8,000 years separates us, genetically we are so alike, but we must accept there are huge differences in how we look at the world."The bust is now on display at Charlottenborg manor house in Motala, Sweden.Photos: See the ancient faces of a man-bun wearing bloke and a Neanderthal womanPhotos: The reconstruction of a teen who lived 9,000 years agoIn photos: A nearly complete human ancestor skullOriginally published on Live Science.\nOFFER: Save 45% on \'How It Works\' \'All About Space\' and \'All About History\'!\nFor a limited time, you can take out a digital subscription to any of our best-selling science magazines for just $2.38 per month, or 45% off the standard price for the first three months.View Deal\nSee all comments (0)\nNo comments yet\nComment from the forums\nSign Up for e-mail newsletters\nStay up to date on the coronavirus outbreak by signing up to our newsletter today.\nThank you for signing up to Live Science.

Cats are one of them.\nShares\nComments (3)\nCat photos can be cat-astrophic for your love life.\n(Image: © Shutterstock)\nCan posing with a pet help men find dating success? Not if the pet is a cat, scientists say.Posing with a cat makes men less desirable to women, compared with when they pose without their feline friends, researchers recently discovered.\xa0Overall, women rated cat-less photos of the same man higher on desirable qualities, with more women saying that they would be likely to consider the man for both long-term and short-term relationships, according to a new study.Related: Photos: See the world through a cat\'s eyesPreviously, other studies had found that women considered pet-owning men to be "more attractive and dateable" than men who did not own pets, but this effect was usually associated with dog ownership.\xa0This led the scientists to ask: Would men with cats be more desirable than men on their own?\xa0To answer that question, the researchers conducted two surveys: one with 708 participants and one with 680 participants. Study subjects were all American residents between the ages of 18 and 24, and who identified as female and heterosexual.Depending on the group, the women looked at photos of one of two white men — "Male 1" or "Male 2" — who were in their early 20s and wearing blue button-down shirts. The participants looked at two versions of the photo of each man: either with or without a catWhen the first group viewed "Male 1" alone, they saw him as "more extraverted than when pictured with the cat," the scientists reported. And when "Male 1" was pictured with a cat, study participants saw him as "more agreeable, neurotic and open," than when he posed solo, according to the study.\xa0"Male 2" also scored higher in extraversion and conscientiousness when alone, and higher in agreeableness and openness when pictured with a cat.And how did holding a cat affect the men\'s desirability as mates? In the first group, about 30% of those surveyed said they\'d be more likely to enter a relationship with the cat-free man, compared with 19% who said they\'d be more likely to date the cat-holder. Preferences in the second group were more equally divided, with only about 23% favoring the cat-less man and 19% preferring the cat snuggler.In both groups, about 50% of the participants found the men equally dateable regardless of whether or not they held a cat."Male 1" and "Male 2" were evaluated in photos with and without cats. (Image credit: L. Kogan/S. Volsche)But were some of the study subjects predisposed to judge cats — and the men who love them — too harshly? While about 19% of the subjects in both groups said they were "cat people," 48% called themselves "dog people" (24% said they were both, while around 10% said they were neither).\xa0Other studies have shown that men who are considered dog-lovers are perceived as being more independent and masculine, the scientists reported. Identifying as a "dog person" may therefore also embrace a cat-centric bias that is pervasive in American culture; branding cat-loving men as "less masculine" and perhaps "creating a cultural preference for \'dog men\' among most heterosexual women in the studied age group," according to the study.Might interpretations about dateability then be applicable to photos of men posing with dogs? Follow-up research could incorporate photos into the survey that show men with dogs, to test subjects\' responses to different species, the scientists said."Would women find the man alone more or less masculine than a man with a dog? Further, what role would the size/breed of the dog play in these perceptions?" These and other questions "remain an area for future research," the researchers concluded.\xa0The findings were published online June 9 in the journal Animals.Meet the rare and fabulous felines of \'Super Cats\' (photos)20 weird cat and dog behaviors explained by scienceRingtail cats: Photos of the \'cutest animal in North America\'Originally published on Live Science.\nOFFER: Save 45% on \'How It Works\' \'All About Space\' and \'All About History\'!\nFor a limited time, you can take out a digital subscription to any of our best-selling science magazines for just $2.38 per month, or 45% off the standard price for the first three months.View Deal\nSee all comments (3)\n3 Comments\nComment from the forums\ndannykun\n30 June 2020 01:59\nWith all due respect, it seems that this experiment has some confounding issues. First, I don\'t sere what the point of using only two men was... right away that made me worried whether or not the statistics could be trusted. Second, it just so happens that both of the men have more strongly bulging forehead veins in the with-cat pictures. It\'s a strange thing that I wouldn\'t think to worry about during the experimental design phase, but it turns out to be pretty noticeable even at the picture size of a thumbnail. Third, it\'s clearly a photoshoot style picture. For the without-cat picture it looks like it could be any run-of-the-mill passport photo kind of photoshoot--no problem. But the with-cat picture begs the question: did this guy bring his cat to a photoshoot? It takes a specific type of personality to go on a photoshoot with your cat, and(, in agreement with the results,) I would guess someone who does that is more neurotic than someone who doesn\'t. Lastly, even if you photoshopped in a bulldog or some perceived-to-be-masculine dog that could actually fit in with their pose, it would still look like a less masculine pose than the without-cat poses. The without-cat poses present men who are square with the camera, in poses that looks relatively assertive. The with-cat poses are a bit more hunched over, looking more delicate, giving their shoulder to the camera, perhaps subconsciously indicating some kind of passiveness of personality. Either way, it seems to me, independent of the presence of a cat, the without-cat pose could be perceived as more masculine and therefore more attractive to heterosexual women.\nI could be wrong about some of this and I welcome other viewpoints! I especially don\'t know if there is some statistically justified reason for using only two men. But without hearing any good counterarguments, I would be wary of drawing too strong of conclusions from this experiment\'s data...\nReply\nDeAnn\n30 June 2020 02:12\nObviously, this is not science. Any person who loves and takes care of animals is probably better than those who don\'t. To suggest that loving cats is something unnatural is ridiculous and repulsive. A lot more information is need to draw any conclusions.\nReply\ntalktodakota\n30 June 2020 04:49\nOh bull. Dog guys are a dime a dozen and so predictable. Cat snugglers are gold. They know how to do all those sweet, gentle moves that keep you coming back plus they have realized they are not the center of the universe and learned the art of paying attention. Come on ladies do you want a guy who knows how to tell commands or one who know finesse?\nSome dog guys may defy the odds. But a cat guy is a real find.\nThe "scientists" here should eat their hats.\nReply\nView All 3 Comments\nSign Up for e-mail newsletters\nStay up to date on the coronavirus outbreak by signing up to our newsletter today.\nThank you for signing up to Live Science.

Probably about as much as the last millionth of a second meant to you. Still, every decade that our old sun burns on is a decade of turbulent, sometimes violent change — a fact that becomes beautifully evident in a new time-lapse video from NASA\'s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).In the stunning video, titled "A Decade of Sun," astronomers compiled 425 million high-definition images of the sun, snapped once every 0.75 seconds between June 2, 2010 and June 1, 2020. Each second of the video represents one day in the sun\'s life, and the entire decade blazes by in about 60 minutes (though you can see our 6-minute highlight reel above).During that decade, the sun undergoes a sea change, slowly bubbling with enormous magnetic ripples known as sunspots, which peaked around 2014 before fading away again. The sun\'s quiescence wasn\'t a surprise; every 11 years or so, the sun\'s magnetic poles suddenly switch places; North becomes South, solar magnetic activity begins to wane, and the sun\'s surface starts to look like a tranquil sea of yellow fire. This period of relative calm is called a solar minimum (and we are currently in the midst of one).Halfway between one decade\'s flip-flop and the next, however, a violent shift occurs. Magnetic activity increases to a vibrant high, known as a solar maximum, and the star\'s surface ripples with gigantic sunspots, bristles with lashing magnetic field lines and pops with plasma explosions known as solar flares. Each maximum peaks with another magnetic pole reversal, signaling the start of a new solar cycle.These changes are hard to spot from Earth with the naked eye (though solar maxima do result in more visible auroras at lower latitudes around the world), but NASA\'s SDO satellite sees them clearly as it monitors our star in extreme ultraviolet light. These ultra-energetic wavelengths cut through the sun\'s glare and reveal the abundant magnetic changes in the sun\'s outermost atmosphere, or corona. It\'s a stunning spectacle to see — even if the sun has probably already forgotten all about it.Spaced out! 101 astronomy images that will blow your mind15 amazing images of starsSatellites gallery: Science from aboveOriginally published on Live Science.\nOFFER: Save 45% on \'How It Works\' \'All About Space\' and \'All About History\'!\nFor a limited time, you can take out a digital subscription to any of our best-selling science magazines for just $2.38 per month, or 45% off the standard price for the first three months.View Deal\nSee all comments (5)\n5 Comments\nComment from the forums\nDarr247\n26 June 2020 21:04\nI caught 8 frames of the 05/06 June 2012 Venus Transit from about 12 minutes 24/25 seconds... anyone find a way to get more?\nReply\nDarr247\n26 June 2020 21:31\ngtaUd9EView: https://i.imgur.com/gtaUd9E.jpg\nFrame 1\nReply\narnbar\n29 June 2020 01:28\nadmin said:NASA combined 10 years of solar observations into a single, gorgeous time-lapse video.\nIncredible time-lapse video shows 10 years of the sun\'s history in 6 minutes : Read more\nCAN ANYONE ANSWER THESE TWO QUESTIONS:\n1.

The resemblance is so uncanny that the researchers who described the arachnid named the species after actor Joaquin Phoenix, who portrayed the tormented, smiling villain in the 2019 film, "Joker."Ironically, the colorful spider belongs to a genus that was named for the late punk rock icon Lou Reed, who famously wore black and rarely smiled.Scientists discovered Loureedia phoenixi in Iran; it\'s the first Loureedia spider to be identified outside the Mediterranean region, they reported in a new study. The genus, first described in 2018, now includes four species.Related: Incredible photos of peacock spiders\xa0On the backs of the male L. phoenixi spiders, a splash of vivid red stands out against a background of white, much like the Joker\'s unnerving smile contrasts with his white facial makeup, the scientists wrote in the study. Though, you\'d need magnification to see it clearly, as the spider\'s body measures only about 0.3 inches (8 millimeters) long and is covered in tiny hairs.In fact, spiders in this family — Eresidae — are known as velvet spiders because they sport dense, velvety coats, said lead study author Alireza Zamani, an arachnologist and doctoral candidate in the Biodiversity Unit at the University of Turku in Finland. Velvet spiders are especially interesting to arachnologists because some have unusual habits, such as cooperating to build communal nests and collectively caring for their young, Zamani told Live Science in an email.Discovering Loureedia spiders is challenging, because the arachnids are active aboveground only for a three-week period each year."These spiders spend most of their lives in their subterranean nests," Zamani said. Males leave their burrows to hunt for females, "usually from late October to mid-November," and spiderlings come to the surface when they leave their mother\'s nest, he explained.This is the fourth species to be described in the genus Loureedia, which was named for the musician Lou Reed.\xa0 (Image credit: Niloofar Sheikh)So far, scientists have collected and described only male Joker spiders. But the search will continue for the elusive females, targeting locations where males have been found."Ideally, if you have enough time and patience, it would be interesting to track\na wandering male. He should know how to find the female better than anyone else," Zamani said. "This way, you would also have the chance of observing and photographing the actual mating behavior, which has not been documented for any Loureedia species yet," he added.The findings were published in the June issue of the journal Arthropoda Selecta.Weird and Wonderful: 9 Bizarre SpidersCreepy, crawly & incredible: Photos of spiders\xa0In photos: Fish-eating spiders around the worldOriginally published on Live Science.\nOFFER: Save 45% on \'How It Works\' \'All About Space\' and \'All About History\'!\nFor a limited time, you can take out a digital subscription to any of our best-selling science magazines for just $2.38 per month, or 45% off the standard price for the first three months.View Deal\nSee all comments (0)\nNo comments yet\nComment from the forums\nSign Up for e-mail newsletters\nStay up to date on the coronavirus outbreak by signing up to our newsletter today.\nThank you for signing up to Live Science.

Here\'s what scientists are finding.\nBy\nLive Science Staff\n19 June 2020\nShares\nComments (6)\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus invades human cells by attaching to ACE2 receptors on the surfaces of those cells.\n(Image: © Shutterstock)\nThe novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 seems to hit some people harder than others, with some people experiencing only mild symptoms and others being hospitalized and requiring ventilation. Though scientists at first thought age was the dominant factor, with young people avoiding the worst outcomes, new research has revealed a suite of features impacting disease severity. These influences could explain why some perfectly healthy 20-year-old with the disease is in dire straits, while an older 70-year-old dodges the need for critical interventions.Underlying health conditions are thought to be an important factor influencing disease severity. Indeed, a study of more than 1.3 million COVID-19 cases in the United States, published June 15 in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, found that rates of hospitalizations were six times higher and rates of death were 12 times higher among COVID-19 patients with underlying conditions, compared with patients without underlying conditions. The most commonly reported underlying conditions were heart disease, diabetes and chronic lung disease.\xa0In general, risk factors for more severe COVID-19 outcomes include:\nAge\nDiabetes (type 1 and type 2)\nHeart disease and hypertension\nSmoking\nBlood type\nObesity\nGenetic factorsAgeAbout 8 out of 10 deaths associated with COVID-19 in the U.S. have occurred in adults ages 65 and older, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The risk of dying from the infection, and the likelihood of requiring hospitalization or intensive medical care, increases significantly with age. For instance, adults ages 65-84 make up an estimated 4-11% of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S, while adults ages 85 and above make up 10-27%.\xa0The trend may be due, in part, to the fact that many elderly people have chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, that can exacerbate the symptoms of COVID-19, according to the CDC. The ability of the immune system to fight off pathogens also declines with age, leaving elderly people vulnerable to severe viral infections, Stat News reported.Related: Coronavirus in the US: Latest COVID-19 news and case countsDiabetes(Image credit: Shutterstock)Diabetes mellitus — a group of diseases that result in harmful high blood sugar levels — also seems to be linked to risk of more severe COVID-19 infections.\xa0The most common form in the U.S. is type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body\'s cells don\'t respond to the hormone insulin. As a result, the sugar that would otherwise move from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy just builds up in the bloodstream. (When the pancreas makes little to no insulin in the first place, the condition is called type 1 diabetes.)In a review of 13 relevant studies, scientists found that people with diabetes were nearly 3.7 times more likely to have a critical case of COVID-19 or to die from the disease compared with COVID-19 patients without any underlying health conditions (including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease or respiratory disease), they reported online April 23 in the Journal of Infection.Even so, scientists don\'t know whether diabetes is directly increasing severity or whether other health conditions that seem to tag along with diabetes, including cardiovascular and kidney conditions, are to blame.\xa0That fits with what researchers have seen with other infections and diabetes. For instance, flu and pneumonia are more common and more serious in older individuals with type 2 diabetes, scientists reported online April 9 in the journal Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice. In a literature search of relevant studies looking at the link between COVID-19 and diabetes, the authors of that paper found a few possible mechanisms to explain why a person with diabetes might fare worse when infected with COVID-19. These mechanisms include: "Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2."Related: 13 coronavirus myths busted by science\xa0Mounting research has shown the progression of type 2 diabetes is tied to changes in the body\'s immune system. This link could also play a role in poorer outcomes in a person with diabetes exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\xa0No research has looked at this particular virus and immune response in patients with diabetes; however, in a study published in 2018 in the Journal of Diabetes Research, scientists found through a review of past research that patients with obesity or diabetes showed immune systems that were out of whack, with an impairment of white blood cells called Natural Killer (NK) cells and B cells, both of which help the body fight off infections. The research also showed that these patients had an increase in the production of inflammatory molecules called cytokines. When the immune system secretes too many cytokines,a so-called "cytokine storm" can erupt and damage the body\'s organs. Some research has suggested that cytokine storms may be responsible for causing serious complications in people with COVID-19, Live Science previously reported. Overall, type 2 diabetes has been linked with impairment of the very system in the body that helps to fight off infections like COVID-19 and could explain why a person with diabetes is at high risk for a severe infection.Not all people with type 2 diabetes are at the same risk, though: A study published May 1 in the journal Cell Metabolism found that people with diabetes who keep their blood sugar levels in a tighter range were much less likely to have a severe disease course than those with more fluctuations in their blood sugar levels.\xa0People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are also at elevated risk of adverse outcomes, a small study published in Diabetes Care suggests. The study, coordinated by \xa0T1D Exchange — a nonprofit research organization focused on therapies for those with type 1 diabetes — found that of 64 people with either COVID-19 or COVID-19-like symptoms, two died. Nearly 4 in 10 people had to be treated in a hospital. And nearly a third experienced diabetic ketoacidosis — a potentially deadly condition in which the body experiences a shortage of insulin and blood sugar levels rise dangerously high. \xa0The average patient was about 21 years old, suggesting that risks could be potentially higher for older age groups.Heart disease and hypertension(Image credit: Shutterstock)People with conditions that affect the cardiovascular system, such as heart disease and hypertension, generally suffer worse complications from COVID-19 than those with no preexisting conditions, according to the American Heart Association. That said, historically healthy people can also suffer heart damage from the viral infection.\xa0The first reported coronavirus death in the U.S., for instance, occurred when the virus somehow damaged a woman\'s heart muscle, eventually causing it to burst, Live Science reported. The 57-year-old maintained good health and exercised regularly before becoming infected, and she reportedly had a healthy heart of "normal size and weight." A study of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, found that more than 1 in 5 patients developed heart damage — some of the sampled patients had existing heart conditions, and some did not.\xa0In seeing these patterns emerge, scientists developed several theories as to why COVID-19 might hurt both damaged hearts and healthy ones, according to a Live Science report.\xa0In one scenario, by attacking the lungs directly, the virus might deplete the body\'s supply of oxygen to the point that the heart must work harder to pump oxygenated blood through the body. The virus might also attack the heart directly, as cardiac tissue contains angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) — a molecule that the virus plugs into to infect cells. In some individuals, COVID-19 can also kickstart an overblown immune response known as a cytokine storm, wherein the body becomes severely inflamed and the heart could suffer damage as a result.Smoking(Image credit: Shutterstock)People who smoke cigarettes may be prone to severe COVID-19 infections, meaning they face a heightened risk of developing pneumonia, suffering organ damage and requiring breathing support. A study of more than 1,000 patients in China, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, illustrates this trend: 12.3% of current smokers included in the study were admitted to an ICU, were placed on a ventilator or died, as compared with 4.7% of nonsmokers.\xa0Cigarette smoke might render the body vulnerable to the coronavirus in several ways, according to a recent Live Science report. At baseline, smokers may be vulnerable to catching viral infections because smoke exposure dampens the immune system over time, damages tissues of the respiratory tract and triggers chronic inflammation. Smoking is also associated with a multitude of medical conditions, such as emphysema and atherosclerosis, which could exacerbate the symptoms of COVID-19.A recent study, posted March 31 to the preprint database bioRxiv, proposed a more speculative explanation as to why COVID-19 hits smokers harder. The preliminary research has not yet been peer-reviewed, but early interpretations of the data suggest that smoke exposure increases the number of ACE2 receptors in the lungs — the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 plugs into to infect cells.\xa0Many of the receptors appear on so-called goblet and club cells, which secrete a mucus-like fluid to protect respiratory tissues from pathogens, debris and toxins. It\'s well-established that these cells grow in number the longer a person smokes, but scientists don\'t know whether the subsequent boost in ACE2 receptors directly translates to worse COVID-19 symptoms. What\'s more, it\'s unknown whether high ACE2 levels are relatively unique to smokers, or common among people with chronic lung conditions.ObesitySeveral early studies have suggested a link between obesity and more severe COVID-19 disease in people. One study, which analyzed a group of COVID-19 patients who were younger than the age of 60 in New York City, found that those who were obese were twice as likely as non-obese individuals to be hospitalized and were 1.8 times as likely to be admitted into critical care.\xa0"This has important and practical implications" in a country like the U.S. where nearly 40% of adults are obese, the authors wrote in the study, which was accepted into the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases but not yet peer-reviewed or published. Similarly, another preliminary study that hasn\'t yet been peer-reviewed found that the two biggest risk factors for being hospitalized from the coronavirus are age and obesity. This study, published in medRxiv looked at data from thousands of COVID-19 patients in New York City, but studies from other cities around the world found similar results, as reported by The New York Times.A preliminary study from Shenzhen, China, which also hasn\'t been peer-reviewed, found that obese COVID-19 patients were more than twice as likely to develop severe pneumonia as compared with patients who were normal weight, according to the report published as a preprint online in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Those who were overweight, but not obese, had an 86% higher risk of developing severe pneumonia than did people of "normal" weight, the authors reported. Another study, accepted into the journal Obesity and peer-reviewed, found that nearly half of 124 COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit in Lille, France, were obese.It\'s not clear why obesity is linked to more hospitalizations and more severe COVID-19 disease, but there are several possibilities, the authors wrote in the study. Obesity is generally thought of as a risk factor for severe infection. For example, those who are obese had longer and more severe disease during the swine flu epidemic, the authors wrote. Obese patients might also have reduced lung capacity or increased inflammation in the body. A greater number of inflammatory molecules circulating in the body might cause harmful immune responses and lead to severe disease.Blood type(Image credit: Shutterstock)Blood type seems to be a predictor of how susceptible a person is to contracting SARS-CoV-2, though scientists haven\'t found a link between blood type per se and severity of disease.Jiao Zhao, of The Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, and colleagues looked at blood types of 2,173 patients with COVID-19 in three hospitals in Wuhan, China, as well as blood types of more than 23,000 non-COVID-19 individuals in Wuhan and Shenzhen. They found that individuals with blood types in the A group (A-positive, A-negative and AB-positive, AB-negative) were at a higher risk of contracting the disease compared with non-A-group types. People with O blood types (O-negative and O-positive) had a lower risk of getting the infection compared with non-O blood types, the scientists wrote in the preprint database medRxiv on March 27; the study has yet to be reviewed by peers in the field.In a more recent study of blood type and COVID-19, published online April 11 to medRxiv, scientists looked at 1,559 people tested for SARS-CoV-2 at New York Presbyterian hospital; of those, 682 tested positive. Individuals with A blood types (A-positive and A-negative) were 33% more likely to test positive than other blood types and both O-negative and O-positive blood types were less likely to test positive than other blood groups. (There\'s a 95% chance that the increase in risk ranges from 7% to 67% more likely.) Though only 68 individuals with an AB blood type were included, the results showed this group was also less likely than others to test positive for COVID-19.\xa0The researchers considered associations between blood type and risk factors for COVID-19, including age, sex, whether a person was overweight, other underlying health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pulmonary diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Some of these factors are linked to blood type, they found, with a link between diabetes and B and A-negative blood types, between overweight status and O-positive blood groups, for instance, among others. When they accounted for these links, the researchers still found an association between blood type and COVID-19 susceptibility. When the researchers pooled their data with the research by Zhao and colleagues out of China, they found similar results as well as a significant drop in positive COVID-19 cases among blood type B individuals.Why blood type might increase or decrease a person\'s risk of getting SARS-CoV-2 is not known. A person\'s blood type indicates what kind of certain antigens cover the surfaces of their blood cells; These antigens produce certain antibodies to help fight off a pathogen. Past research has suggested that at least in the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), anti-A antibodies helped to inhibit the virus; that could be the same mechanism with SARS-CoV-2, helping blood group O individuals to keep out the virus, according to Zhao\'s team.Genetic factors(Image credit: Shutterstock)Many medical conditions can worsen the symptoms of COVID-19, but why do historically healthy people sometimes fall dangerously ill or die from the virus? Scientists suspect that certain genetic factors may leave some people especially susceptible to the disease, and many research groups aim to pinpoint exactly where those vulnerabilities lie in our genetic code.\xa0In one scenario, the genes that instruct cells to build ACE2 receptors may differ between people who contract severe infections and those who hardly develop any symptoms at all, Science magazine reported. Alternatively, differences may lie in genes that help rally the immune system against invasive pathogens, according to a recent Live Science report.For instance, a study published April 17 in the Journal of Virology suggests that specific combinations of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, which train immune cells to recognize germs, may be protective against SARS-CoV-2, while other combinations leave the body open to attack. HLAs represent just one cog in our immune system machinery, though, so their relative influence over COVID-19 infection remains unclear. Additionally, the Journal of Virology study only used computer models to simulate HLA activity against the coronavirus; clinical and genetic data from COVID-19 patients would be needed to flesh out the role of HLAs in real-life immune responses.\xa0\xa0The 12 deadliest viruses on Earth \xa0\xa020 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history \xa0\xa011 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across speciesOriginally published on Live Science.\nOFFER: Save 45% on \'How It Works\' \'All About Space\' and \'All About History\'!\nFor a limited time, you can take out a digital subscription to any of our best-selling science magazines for just $2.38 per month, or 45% off the standard price for the first three months.View Deal\nSee all comments (6)\n6 Comments\nComment from the forums\nediso74\n06 May 2020 11:35\nadmin said:The novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 seems to hit some people harder than others, with some people experiencing just mild symptoms and others being hospitalized and requiring ventilation.

It has been extremely well borne out that age is the dominant factor associated with risk, as the CDC stats make clear: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku/data . As noted in https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20108969v1 , completely uncontrolled diabetes gives one the vulnerability of someone approximately 10 years older than they are, as does a BMI above 40; using the figures in the article about blood type, having type A is equivalent to 3 years\' risk (95% confidence interval 1 year to 6 years).

Fruits may be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried, and may be whole, cut-up, or pureed.\nHow much fruit is needed daily?\nThe amount of fruit you need to eat depends on age, sex, and level of physical activity. The amount each person needs can vary between 1 and 2 cups each day. Those who are very physically active may need more. Recommended daily amounts are shown in the table below.Note: Click on the top row to expand the table. If you are on a mobile device, you may need to turn your phone to see the full table.\nDaily Fruit Table\nDaily Recommendations*\nChildren\n2-3 yrs\n1 cup\n4-8 yrs\n1 to 1½ cups\nGirls\n9-13 yrs\n1½ cups\n14-18 yrs\n1½ cups\nBoys\n9-13 yrs\n1½ cups\n14-18 yrs\n2 cups\nWomen\n19-30 yrs\n2 cups\n31-50 yrs\n1½ cups\n51+ yrs\n1½ cups\nMen\n19-30 yrs\n2 cups\n31-50 yrs\n2 cups\n51+ yrs\n2 cups\n*These amounts are appropriate for individuals who get less than 30 minutes per day of moderate physical activity, beyond normal daily activities.

People who incorporate fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy eating pattern have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases.\xa0USDA's MyPlate encourages filling half of the plate with fruits and vegetables at mealtimes. Fruits are an important part of a healthy eating pattern and the source of many vital nutrients, including potassium, folate (folic acid), and antioxidants including polyphenols. Fruit such as blueberries, cranberries, strawberries\xa0and citrus also contain phytochemicals that are being studied for their added health benefits.\xa0\xa0How Many Servings of Fruit Are Recommended?\xa0Daily Recommendation\xa0\xa0\xa0AgeNo. of servingsChildren2–8 years1–1.5 cupsGirls9–18 years1.5 cupsBoys9–18 years1.5–2 cupsWomen19–30 years2 cupsWomen31+ years1.5 cupsMen19+ years2 cupsEssential Nutrients in FruitThe nutrients in fruit are vital for overall health and maintenance of body systems. The benefits of these nutrients include:\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Reduced risk of chronic disease: Eating a diet rich in fruit may reduce risk for stroke, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.Improved heart health: The potassium in fruit can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Potassium may also reduce the risk of developing kidney stones and help to decrease bone loss.Lower risk of neural tube defects: Folate (folic acid) helps the body form red blood cells. Women of childbearing age who may become pregnant and those in the first trimester of pregnancy need adequate folate. Folate helps prevent neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida.\xa0Protection against cell damage: An eating pattern where fruit is\xa0part of an overall healthy diet provides antioxidants that help repair damage done by free radicals and may protect against certain cancers. It may also have a positive impact on digestive health. Polyphenols are antioxidants\xa0that have been shown to alter gut microecology, or the proportion of healthy versus harmful bacteria.\xa0Find out more about the relationship of a healthy eating pattern and activity on overall health by visiting the\xa0Healthy Eating\xa0page.\xa0References Why is it important to eat fruit?

Insert a popsicle stick into each, and bake for 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake popsicles to cool for at least 15 minutes before gently removing from the molds and transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.Buttercream Frosting:You can prepare the frosting for the mermaid’s scales while waiting for the cake pops to cool. Place the softened butter in a mixing bowl, and beat, on medium speed, using a hand mixer or stand mixer for 3 minutes until the butter is light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and mix again until incorporated. Add the powdered sugar and mix again while slowly adding the milk. You will want to start on low then work your way up to about medium speed after adding the powdered sugar or else you will have a cloud of it all over your kitchen! Mix until smooth. Divide the frosting evenly among 3 small bowls. Add a little pink, sky blue, and lavender coloring to each bowl, and mix until combined. You only need a little to achieve a soft shade, and the colors will develop and deepen a bit more as you allow them to sit prior to piping.Mermaid Decorations:Add half a bag of the bright pink and blue candy melts to 2 separate wide mouth glass jars, and then fill the rest of each jar almost completely with white candy melts. Add 1 bag of white candy melts to a third jar. Heat each jar, in the microwave, for 1 minute at 50% power, and then stir. Continue to heat in 30-second intervals, at 50% power, stirring between each set until the candy melts are smooth and fully melted in each jar. Adding white to each color creates a pastel look. If any of your melts are still lumpy looking after melting them you can add about 2 tablespoons of paramount crystals or 1-2 teaspoons of vegetable oil to each jar. Stir it in until completely combined. If any of the melts harden while working just reheat them in 30-second intervals until smooth again.Bunny Mermaids:Dip all of your bunny cake pops into the melted blue candy melts. Allow the excess to drip off of the top of each before placing onto a piece of wax paper to set. If you notice any air bubbles in the coating you can pop them immediately with a toothpick. While waiting for the first coating to harden, break off about a fourth of the fondant to form the ears and paws. Roll little balls of fondant in between your thumb and pointer finger to make the paws. The ears are made by creating teardrop shapes and pinching the tops to form a point. Use a little more of the candy melts like “glue” to attach the ears and paws to the cake pops (you may have to hold the ears on for a few seconds until they set). Once all of the fondant pieces have set to the cake pops dip each pop again into the blue melts (allowing for the excess to drip off). Place them back onto the wax paper to harden completely. If you are having trouble getting the ears to stay straight you can use a marshmallow underneath the ears to prop them up while they harden. Use a little of the melted pink candy melts to make the fins, and also to add a little pink to the inside of each ear. Just dip a toothpick into the melts and use it to “draw” the design (like a flattened heart shape) onto wax paper and allow to set. Break off another smaller piece of the white fondant and mix a little of the pink icing coloring into it until combined. Form tiny balls of the pink fondant and place them onto a piece of wax paper. Flatten each ball out with your fingers to form the cheeks for each animal popsicle. Once your bunnies have set you can add the buttercream mermaid scales (no fancy piping skills required). I like to use a toothpick to draw a guideline onto each pop for the top of the mermaid’s tail. Transfer each color of buttercream frosting into either a piping bag or large zip top bag and cut about 1/2 an inch off of the corner. It’s easiest if you start with the cake pops upside down (the stick pointing up). Pipe large round dots, in alternating colors, across the top of each pop. Then use the back off a spoon to drag the frosting up towards the top of the animal. Continue piping and dragging the frosting as you go, alternating the colors, and slightly overlapping each row until you reach the guideline (you should have about 3 rows of scales on each cake pop). Push each fin into the buttercream scales to hold them in place. Turn the cake pops right side up, and use pearl sprinkles to form a line across the top. Use decorating icing to add the eyes and nose onto each, and a little more of the blue candy melts to attach the seashell or heart bras and hair accessories.Cat Mermaids:Dip all of your cat cake pops into the melted pink candy melts as you did for the bunnies. Place onto wax paper to set. Break off 1/4 piece white fondant and form the paws just like the bunnies, and the ears by pressing little balls of the fondant into a triangle between your thumbs and pointer fingers. Press down on each gently to flatten. Attach the fondant pieces to each cake pop with pink melts, and once set, dip again into the pink candy melts. Make lavender mermaid fins by heating a little of the lavender melts along with a handful of white melts in a small heatproof bowl in 30-second intervals. Once the final coating on the cake pops has hardened you can decorate them just as you did for the bunnies.Panda Mermaids:Dip all of the remaining cake pops into the melted white candy melts just like you did for the other 2 animals. Form paws using a little of the white fondant and attach with the white candy melts. Once the fondant pieces have set you can dip the cake pops again. The panda’s ears and eyes are made using black candy melts. Melt 1/4 bag black candy melts as you did for the other colors, and then draw 2 semi circles for the ears, and 2 ovals for the eyes for each, using a toothpick, onto wax paper. Once the coating on the pops and the black candy melts have set you can use a little more of the white candy melts to attach the ears and eyes to each cake pop, and to draw the lashes onto the eyes. Decorate as you did for the other animals, admire your mer-mazing cake popsicles, and enjoy!\nYOU'LL ALSO LOVE\n12 Fun Popsicle Recipes\n12 photos\nTop 100 Weeknight Dinner Recipes\n42 Best Grilled Main Dishes\nOur 75 Top-Rated Recipes of All Tim...\nView All Recipes\nI Want to Discover\nView Suggestions\nBACK TO TOP\n© 2020\nScripps Networks, LLC.\nAll Rights Reserved.Privacy PolicyVisitor Agreement", 'urls': {'https://www.food.com/user', 'https://www.food.com/upload/recipe', 'https://www.food.com/user/settings'}}, {'url': 'https://www.food.com/user/settings', 'content': 'Notification\nThis site is not available in your country', 'urls': set()}, {'url': 'https://www.food.com/upload/recipe', 'content': 'Notification\nThis site is not available in your country', 'urls': set()}, {'url': 'https://www.food.com/user', 'content': 'Notification\nThis site is not available in your country', 'urls': set()}, {'url': 'https://www.food.com/ideas/top-grilling-recipes-6974#c-810376', 'content': 'Top 100 Grilling Recipes - Food.com\nRecipes\nPOPULAR\nSUMMER GRILLING\nSearch\nStumped for dinner?

It\'s no surprise that classic comfort foods remind you of your childhood. You grew up with your mom making your favorite soothing meal as a consolation prize when you deserved a reward, when you weren\'t feeling swell, or when you just needed a hug.\nOf course, dishes like mac \'n cheese, mashed potatoes, and meatloaf have stood the test of time and are still giving comfort to this day. However, there are countless once-upon-a-time dishes that did their job well, but for whatever reason, are no longer around for the party. Take a trip down memory lane with these comfort foods you haven\'t eaten in years.\n1\nChicken a la King\nShutterstockQueen of the comfort food dinners in the early 20th century, especially in winter, this steamy rich dish was created with diced chicken, mushrooms, veggies, and sherry cream sauce and served over toast or biscuits. It was crowned in the 1800s, appearing on menus in upscale restaurants, namely in New York City. But in the \'50s, Chicken a la King held court in households across the nation. Turkey a la King was just as indulgent, but neither are served as often today as a similar classic: chicken pot pie.\nWe love this Chicken a la King recipe from Taste & Tell.\nRELATED: Sign up for our newsletter to get daily recipes and food news in your inbox!\n2\nEgg Cream\nShutterstockWith Jewish and New York City roots, this drink doesn\'t actually contain eggs or cream.\xa0It was a regionally revered beverage made with chocolate, seltzer, and milk and served often at soda fountains and in luncheonettes.\nWe love this recipe for a Nutella Egg Cream from My Name is Yeh.\nRELATED: Your ultimate restaurant and supermarket survival guide is here!\n3\nFluffernutter Sandwiches\nShutterstockMarshmallow fluff is the quintessential feel-good food. I have a friend who always travels with a jar of the stuff—she eats it with a spoon straight out of the jar. In the \'60s and \'70s, peanut butter and marshmallow fluff slathered between two slices of white bread became a comfort sandwich for kids, but not so much anymore (perhaps because many of us are watching our sugar intake). By the way, National Fluffernutter Day is October 8, if you need an excuse to eat this classic sandwich.\nWant to give the old recipe a new spin? Try this Fluffernutter Panini recipe from Taste & Tell.\nRELATED: Click here for all of our latest coronavirus coverage.\n4\nTapioca Pudding\nShutterstockThis is your grandmother\'s comfort food: a pudding made with tapioca and cream or milk, served cold or (better yet) warm. Tapioca is a starch extracted from the cassava root; these days, you\'ll find it in bubble tea more often than in pudding.\nWe love this recipe for Vanilla Honey Tapioca Pudding from Foraged Dish.\n5\nBaked Apples\nShutterstockThis comfort fruit dish, especially popular in the fall, was in its heyday in the \'50s. It was one of the "healthier" comfort foods and is typically baked with cinnamon, sugar and butter.\nWe love this recipe for Cinnamon Baked Apples from Minimalist Baker.\nRELATED: This 7-day smoothie diet will help you shed those last few pounds.\n6\nWelsh Rarebit\nShutterstockWelsh rarebit was the ultimate comfort food dinner: a quick meal built with toasted bread blanketed with a cheesy sauce (sometimes made with beer) and then baked or broiled. (My dad used the Stouffer\'s boxed version, which he would doctor with bacon and tomatoes.) It was a savory comfort dish that\'s sadly vanished from dining tables.\nMore on Dessert\nWhat Happens to Your Body When You Eat Dessert Every Day\nIndulging your sweet cravings every day can have disastrous effects on your health.\n50 Amazing Summer Dessert Recipes\nBonus: They\'re actually healthy, too.\nHow to Make the Best Old-Fashioned Milkshake\nThese will rival the ones at the ice cream shop.\nThe Unhealthiest Desserts in America\nThese are just the worst of the worst!\n15 Delicious Vegan Ice Creams\nEven dairy lovers will want to try these.\nWe like this Welsh Rarebit Recipe from I Am a Food Blog.\n7\nTuna Noodle Casserole\nShutterstockThis dish evokes childhood memories, and maybe that\'s the most comforting thing about it. It was a family meal featuring canned tuna fish, shredded cheese, canned veggies like peas or corn, and that clutch Cream of Mushroom soup. A can of fried onions sprinkled on top gave this casserole its comfort crunch.\nWe like this Tuna Noodle Casserole recipe from Ambitious Kitchen.\nRELATED: Learn how to harness the power of tea to lose weight.\n8\nRice Pudding\nShutterstockRice pudding has a storied history and has had a place at the table in regions throughout the world for centuries. In the United States, rice pudding is commonly made with rice, milk, butter, and cinnamon. It\'s particularly comforting when served warm, and it\'s made even more gratifying with the addition of whiskey or maple syrup.\nWe love this Creamy Rice Pudding recipe from Lil\' Luna.\n9\nTV Dinners\nShutterstockWhen the \'rents went out for the evening, it was TV dinners for the kiddos. Today, it\'s more like take-out or delivery night. TV dinners were a fun-loving meal where you could eat on a TV tray, not at the dinner table, and watch the night\'s television lineup (on 13 channels). Swanson\'s Hungry Man Turkey TV Dinner was a popular dinner in the \'70s, and so was Swanson\'s Salisbury Steak TV Dinner with its tiny compartments of peas, mashed potatoes and cobbler dessert.\nReady for more throwbacks? These Old TV Dinners Will Make You So Nostalgic For Your Childhood.\n10\nRoot Beer Float\nShutterstockA foamy dessert made with root beer and generous scoops of vanilla ice cream, a root beer float was often shared on first dates with high school sweethearts, or with grandpa at the soda fountain.\nWe love this Classic Root Beer Float recipe from Diethood.\n11\nGrandma\'s Corn Pudding\nShutterstockTalk about Southern comfort—even the name of this dish is consoling. It was once very popular in the South and is created using corn, eggs, milk or heavy cream, sugar, and butter. We think it\'s still \'gram-worthy today.\nWe like this Creamy Corn Pudding recipe from Cupcakes & Kale Chips.\n12\nPudding\nShutterstockA dessert that seemed to melt away emotional and physical pain, popular flavors were chocolate, vanilla, and butterscotch. And banana pudding with Nilla Wafers in the \'50s was a hit, especially in the South. Now, you\'re more likely to find pudding cups in hospital cafeterias before ever whipping it up at home yourself.\nWe love this recipe for Homemade Chocolate Pudding from Five Heart Home.\n13\nJell-O\nShutterstockWiggly, squiggly, sugary, and colorful, there were no redeeming healthy qualities to this gelatinous dessert. It was a desired comfort food whether as a snack at home, or even at a holiday meal in the form of a Jell-O salad mold made in a Bundt pan.\nTry using the classic treat to make this pretty Stained Glass Jello recipe from Gimme Some Oven.\n14\nFranks and Baked Beans\nShutterstockA comfort supper, especially in New England, this meal was inexpensive and hearty. It\'s made, of course, with frankfurters, but the secret was in those beans, typically simmered in sweet molasses. Throw in some brown bread (homemade in a can or store-bought) and you\'ve got a traditional Saturday night in New England meal.\nNot sure what brand to buy? We Taste-Tested 10 Different Kinds of Baked Beans—Here Are the Best.\n15\nSloppy Joes\nShutterstockJust the idea that it was a sloppy dish was comforting to kids—it was a license to let the meat tumble down their chin and into their lap, at no fault of their own. The loose meat sandwich, which was very popular in the Midwest, was made with a blend of ground beef, onions, tomato sauce or ketchup and Worcestershire sauce and then slopped on a hamburger bun. Who\'s Joe? Who knows.\nWe love this Vegan Sloppy Joe recipe from Minimalist Baker.\nNow that you\'ve taken a trip down memory lane, why not add one of these throwback dishes to your meal plan for the week?\nShe Lost 100 Pounds—And Shows You How!\nRegistered Dietitian and Nutritionist Ilana Muhlstein lost her weight and kept it off—and in You Can Drop It!, she\'ll show you how to lose it, too.

If we don\'t get the right information, our metabolic processes suffer and our health declines.\nIf we get too much food, or food that gives our bodies the wrong instructions, we can become overweight, undernourished, and at risk for the development of diseases and conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease.\nIn short, what we eat is central to our health. \xa0Consider that in light of Webster\'s definition of medicine: "The science and art dealing with the maintenance of health and the prevention, alleviation, or cure of disease."\nFood acts as medicine--to maintain, prevent, and treat disease.\nWhat does food do in our bodies?\nThe nutrients in food enable the cells in our bodies to perform their necessary functions. This quote from a popular textbook describes how the nutrients in food are essential for our physical functioning.\n"Nutrients are the nourishing substances in food that are essential for the growth, development and maintenance of body functions. Essential meaning that if a nutrient is not present, aspects of function and therefore human health decline. When nutrient intake does not regularly meet the nutrient needs dictated by the cell activity, the metabolic processes slow down or even stop."\n- Perspectives in Nutrition, Wardlow and Insel\xa0Get examples of food as information\nIn other words, nutrients give our bodies instructions about how to function. In this sense, food can be seen as a source of "information" for the body.\nThinking about food in this way gives us a view of nutrition that goes beyond calories or grams, good foods or bad foods. This view leads us to focus on foods we should include rather than foods to exclude.\nInstead of viewing food as the enemy, we look to food as a way to create health and reduce disease by helping the body maintain function.\nWhat are some of the issues with our diet?\nOur Standard American Diet (SAD) is not contributing to our health. \xa0Learn about some of the issues.\nProcessing removes nutrients\nOur supermarkets are full of convenient packaged foods that appeal to our taste buds, but compromise our nutrition. Because most of these foods\' natural nutrients are removed in the refining process, we need to get them elsewhere.\nProcessed foods have additives\nOur Standard American Diet relies heavily on processed foods that include artificial color, additives, flavorings, and chemically-altered fats and sweeteners. These additives and chemically altered substances\xa0may be giving our bodies the wrong signals, instead of the information they need to function properly.\nEven "natural" foods have fewer nutrients\nOur food is not the same as it was 20 years ago. Nutrients in the soil have been depleted, so food grown in that soil has fewer nutrients. Chemicals are increasingly used in raising both plants and animals, particularly on huge industrial farms that specialize in a few products.\nWe are eating less variety of foods\nIronically, while 17,000 new products are introduced each year, two-thirds of our calories come from just four foods: corn, soy, wheat, and rice.\nWe eat for convenience, not pleasure\nWe tend to eat for convenience and speed, not health and pleasure. Our fast foods also remove us from the pleasures of creating and savoring a wonderful meal, and our fast pace often prevents us from connecting over a good, slow meal.\n1 of 62 of 63 of 64 of 65 of 66 of 6\nWhat is the connection between food and disease?\nAs a society we are facing significant health problems.\nThe United States ranks ninth in life expectancy among nations in the developed world.\nWe have a workforce plagued with absenteeism and reduced productivity because of chronic health problems, including depression.\n78 percent of healthcare expenditures are for the treatment of chronic disease.\nMany researchers now believe that these problems are partly related to diet. While they used to believe that diseases-such as type II diabetes, obesity, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers - were caused by a single gene mutation, they are now generally attributing these conditions to a network of biological dysfunction. And the food we eat is an important factor in that dysfunction, in part because our diets lack the necessary balance of nutrients (Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 2004).Learn about specific nutrients you need and how to get them\nTo prevent the onset of these diseases, we need to know how multiple nutrients in a diet interact and affect the human body\'s functions, according to the Nutrition Society, Europe\'s largest nutritional organization.\xa0Functional Medicine is a dynamic approach to assessing, preventing, and treating complex and chronic diseases using\xa0nutrition. \xa0This area of healthcare also conducts research on the role that nutrition plays in health.\nThe Functional Medicine Perspective\nOne component of Functional Medicine focuses on how diet impacts health and function. When Functional Medicine practitioners examine the role of nutrition in chronic disease, they look at multiple systems, such as the digestive system, the immune system, and the detoxification system, because of the interconnections between those systems. For instance, because 80% of the immune system is contained in the gastrointestinal system, a person\'s issues with immunity could be related to faulty digestion.\nFunctional Medicine maintains that chronic disease is almost always preceded by a period of declining health in one or more of the body\'s systems. Thus, these practitioners seek to identify early the symptoms that indicate underlying dysfunction, possibly leading to disease.\nOne of the ways Functional Medicine seeks to address declining health is to provide the foods and nutrients needed to restore function. This is a cost effective, non-invasive intervention that aims to stop the progression into disease.\nExample of Cardiovascular Disease\nWhen taking a nutritional approach to health and disease, it is important to understand that one disease might have multiple causes, and one underlying dysfunction might cause multiple diseases. Cardiovascular disease may be among the clearest examples of this concept.\nResearchers have shown that the development of heart disease can be triggered by multiple factors. These factors include insulin resistance, elevated homocysteine, oxidative stress, elevated cholesterol, hypertension, heavy metal toxicity, stress, and inflammation. Each of these factors can be influenced by nutrition and each, in turn, impact our nutritional needs. This applies both to the prevention and treatment of these factors (Textbook of Functional Medicine).\nFor example, a 2007 study shows the importance of optimal mineral balance and how a deficiency in mineral balance can contribute to the development of congestive heart failure (Cardiovascular & Hematological Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2007).\nLynn sees huge health benefits with new approach to food\nAt her first visit to a nutritionist, Lynn (53), just had one goal: "I need to get healthy!" Her cholesterol was elevated (including triglycerides), and she had taken Lipitor for five years. Her blood pressure had been elevated in the past. She had acid reflux and had been on Zantac for 15 years. Find out what happened.\nMore\nLynn works with nutritionist and sees huge health benefits\nAt her first visit to a nutritionist, Lynn (53), just had one goal: "I need to get healthy!" Her cholesterol was elevated (including triglycerides), and she had taken Lipitor for five years. Her blood pressure had been elevated in the past. She had acid reflux and had been on Zantac for 15 years.\nShe slept poorly and experienced sleep apnea and extreme fatigue. She was taking hormone replacement therapy for hormonal headaches that had plagued her for years. She had experienced swollen, painful joints for many years, which had developed into osteoarthritis. Her bowels tended toward constipation, and she craved bread and sweets.\nThe nutritionist noted her systemic inflammation, water retention, swelling, and constipation and suspected a food sensitivity. She suggested that Lynn eliminate corn, dairy, and wheat from her diet; keep track of her body\'s reaction to the changes; and then gradually introduce these foods one at a time.\nWhen Lynn returned four weeks later, she had determined through the elimination diet that she had a corn sensitivity. Since eliminating corn, she reported feeling much better, and the pain in her back and legs had diminished. Her constipation was relieved and much of the swelling and fluid retention also improved. Lynn reported that "I lost only five pounds, but I feel smaller."\nReturning at eight weeks, Lynn reported that the, "changes have been easy." She had lost 20 pounds and her energy was much improved: "I wake up ready for the day." She was walking a mile and a half each day and her cravings for sugar had also diminished, much to her delight. She reported feeling more in control of her eating.\nAt 12 weeks, Lynn said the changes were becoming habit. "I feel so much better." Her energy continued to improve; she had lost a total of 27 pounds, and she experienced less pain.\nEmbedded video for How Does Food Impact Health? > Components > Items\nLearn more with Wellbeing U\nIn Wellbeing U, our newest free online learning experience, you\'ll learn about thriving in life and at work, making changes that stick, wellbeing in the workplace, and how mindfulness can make a difference.

A guided imagery recording or session uses gentle phrases and words that evoke sensations that help us heal.\nGuided imagery works because our bodies do not discern whether an image is real or imagined. When we bring an image to mind, the same parts of the brain light up as if the actual event was happening. So, if we imagine a relaxing image, our bodies relax. Moreover, in a state of relaxed focus (which guided imagery promotes), we are more sensitive to imagery, which makes us capable of more intense healing, growth, learning, and change.\nAlmost anyone can benefit from guided imagery. In most cases, you can practice on your own. You don't even need to believe in guided imagery before starting to experience benefits. Guided imagery can be a powerful way for you to positively influence your emotions and thoughts.\nHow can guided imagery help me?\nAlleviating:\nAnxiety\nStress\nPain\nInsomnia\nCoping with:\nCancer\nMigraine headaches\nIrritable bowel syndrome\nHypertension\nAnxiety\nDepression\nFibromyalgia\nPTSD\nAsthma\nSurgery\nPain\nReaching goals:\nLose weight\nQuit smoking\nPromote healing (wounds, surgery)\nManage chronic pain\nPrepare for public speaking\nPrepare for an athletic event\nSign up for our newsletter\nsign up\nHome\nAbout\nOur Experts\nArticles\nGlossary\nContact Us\nThis site was created by the University of Minnesota's\nDisclaimer\nThis site complies with the HONCode standard for trustworthy health information:\nFor Students, Faculty, and Staff\nOne Stop\nMy U\n© 2016 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

The new functionality is a part of Google’s Knowledge Graph that was launched in May 2012 in the US. Knowledge Graph is a database interconnecting various search results in order to enhance understanding. By offering information in this way, Google aims developing its information engine into a knowledge engine. As to food information, Google wants to help its users to make healthier choices – so it says. For examples how Google’s food information service will be operated, reference is made to its blogspot.\nFood information in the EU\nIn the European Union, food information is considered to be of the essence as well. To that end, rules on food information were revamped under Regulation 1169/2011 (“the Regulation”) on the provision of food information to consumers . This Regulation will enter into force on 13 December 2014 and will bring about a great number of changes in the food information landscape in Europe. On the one hand, the Regulation aims to ensure a high level of protection of consumers’ health and interests by enabling them in making informed choices. On the other hand, the Regulation aims to realise free movement of legally produced and marketed food. But how is this going to be achieved?\nFair information practices\nFirstly, food information shall not be misleading (a) as to the characteristics of the food, (b)\xa0 by attributing to the food effects or properties it does not possess, (c)\xa0 by suggesting that the food possesses special characteristics when in fact all similar food possess such characteristics, (d)\xa0 by suggesting the presence of a particular food or an ingredient, while in fact substitution with another food or ingredient occurred. It should be stressed that food information comprises all information about a food made available to a final consumer. So not only product labels, but also information published on company website, leaflets, advertisements etc.\nSpecific guidelines for mandatory information\nSecondly, the Food Information Regulation provides specific guidelines for mandatory food information, such as the name of the food, the list of ingredients etc. These guidelines relate for instance to the legibility of this information, requiring a minimum font size of 1,2 mm for the x-height, defined in Annex IV to the Regulation. They also relate to the place where mandatory information is shown, requiring that such information appears directly on the package or on a label attached thereto, so not on a separate leaflet. In cases of distance selling, most of the mandatory information should be available before the purchase is concluded. i.e. it should clearly appear on the website where the food at stake is offered for sale. Furthermore, these guidelines cover language requirements, stipulating that mandatory information shall appear in a language easily understood by the consumers of the Member States where a food is marketed. For the Netherlands, this would clearly be Dutch, but the Member States also have the authority to stipulate that the particulars shall be given in one or more languages of the official languages of the European Union. Such language could be used as an alternative but also in addition to the national language.\nNutrition declarations\nThirdly, nutrition declarations have become mandatory under the Regulation. Such declarations shall imperatively include the following seven elements contained in the food product: (1) energy value, (2) amounts of fat, (3) amounts of saturates, (4) amounts of carbohydrates, (5) amount of sugar, (6) amount of proteins and (7) amounts of salt. Furthermore, they may be supplemented with another six elements such as starch and fibre. The nutrition declaration should come in the form of a table, if space permits, and may be placed on the side or on the back of a packaging (not necessarily at the front side). The information provided must be given per 100 mg or 100 ml – only in addition thereto, information per portion can be given, provided that the portion is quantified. In order to indicate reference intakes of food ingredients, quite often the term GDA (Guideline Daily Amount) is used. This is not a requirement under the Regulation, but if used, this should be done in a way consistent with the Regulation. For vitamins and minerals, it is mandatory however to use the term RDA (Recommended Daily Amount).\nConclusion\nThe Food Information Regulation brings about such important modifications for food information, that it is very likely that the packaging of most of the products marketed in Europe needs to be adjusted. The nutrition declarations that Google intends to publish for various foods are just one element of those modifications. It is thereby ironic that in an attempt to harmonize the rules on food information, the Food Information Regulation in the same time creates barriers to EU-wide trade, by means of the language requirements for food information. Furthermore, even if the Regulation regulates food information in great detail (e.g. font prescribed font size), it is questionable whether that framework will work for B2B transactions or in cases where the food is not sold to final consumers (e.g. mass caterers). This is certainly food for further thought.

The ACC in the Netherlands is a self-regulatory body, comparable to the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK and the German Advertising Standards Council (“Deutscher Werberat”)\xa0 . This means that companies (including food business operators) voluntarily submit to the competence of such body and, as far as the Netherlands are concerned, usually comply with its recommendations. In the food space, decisions of these self-regulatory bodies grow in importance, as they quite often are precursors of similar decisions in civil proceedings.\nVanilla custard\nThe decision from the ACC discussed here relates to the FrieslandCampina product referred to in Dutch as Optimel vanille vla, which in English comes down to vanilla custard. In the Netherlands, it’s a product that has been around for years (one of my favourite deserts as a child, especially with a boost of read jam!) The product showed FOP a picture of yellow custard but not any vanilla pods, it contained the description “soft vanilla taste” and the label indicated it contained vanilla aroma, without specifying if the vanilla was from natural or chemical origin. In fact, the vanilla was from chemical origin (in legal terms a “flavouring substance”) and the Dutch food watchdog Foodwatch considered this to be misleading.\nDecision in first instance (19 February 2019)\nIn first instance, the claim from Foodwatch was upheld. Now that the product stated both front and back of pack the word “vanilla” in quite a striking way, the average consumer would reasonably expect the product to contain (real) vanilla, and not just a chemical flavouring substance. Both parties had submitted market surveys with (not surprisingly) the contradictory result that the average consumer would expect (Foodwatch) and would not expect (FrieslandCampina) the product to contain “real” vanilla. Both surveys had been discarded and the practise was considered misleading based on article 7 of the FIC Regulation. Friesland Campina’s defense that in the Netherlands “vanille vla” was a customary name, in the sense of article 2 (c) of the FIC Regulation, for a product of which the average Dutch consumer would understand it does not contain any “real” vanilla was not considered convincing.\nDefence on appeal\nOn appeal, FrieslandCampina had developed three arguments. Firstly, it had argued the description of\xa0“soft vanilla taste” in fact functioned as a so-called taste disclaimer, adequately informing the consumer that product tasted like vanilla, which does not necessarily mean it contains vanilla. Secondly, FrieslandCampina opposed the way in which its market survey had been discarded. Whereas this survey demonstrated 76% of the consumers did not expect the vanilla to originate from fruits from the vanilla plant, the ACC had focused on the remaining part, stating that 26% did have opposite expectations. Thirdly, Friesland Campina had argued that the average consumer knows that the term “flavouring” does not necessarily refer to a particular source, otherwise the term “natural flavouring” would be used.\nDecision on appeal (16 May 2019)\nThis line of defence did not produce the desired result. Overall, the ACC considered FrieslandCampina had overestimated the knowledge of the average food consumer. The name of the product specifically referring to a particular ingredient, the average consumer could undeniably expect the product to contain vanilla. This expectation had been insufficiently “neutralized” by the additional information on the product, like the description “soft vanilla taste” and the aroma in the list of ingredients. FrieslandCampina itself seemed to have understood this as well. During the oral hearing, it had announced it planned to adjust the packaging of the product at stake.\nPractical implications\nI do not consider the practice to Friesland Campina to be deliberately misleading. As mentioned above, this type of product had been around for decades and personally, I cannot recall the issue at stake to have been an issue at all. In addition, one could say that an average and reasonably well-informed consumer should reasonably understand that if the product contained “real” vanilla, it would be much more expensive. However, times have changed. Enforcement of the FIC regulation is for real and so is the position taken by consumer organisations. More and more consumers do want to know what’s in their food and what not, so FBO’s will need to be more accurate than in the old days in their product labelling and presentation. This implies, amongst other things, that a careful distinction will have to be made between food ingredients on the one hand, and flavourings on the other hand. Furthermore, when using the term “natural” in combination with “flavouring”, at least 95 % of the flavouring component should be obtained from the material referred to. In sum, I expect to see similar decisions in future, not only from self-regulatory bodies like the ACC, but also from civil courts from other EU Member States.\n← Transparency vs. Confidentiality: EFSA’s new role as from March 2021\nTrends at Vitafoods … and what you should know if you decide to be part of it →\nSearch for:\nRecent Posts\nLabeling and Advertising of Alternative Protein\nTowards 100 % recyclable or re-usable plastic food packaging in 10 years\nTrends from Silicon Valley for meat alternatives\nTransparency vs. Confidentiality: EFSA’s new role as from March 2021\nVanilla custard or custard with vanilla taste?\nCategories\nalternative protein\nAuthors\nbeauty claims\ncannabidiol\ncannabis\nclean meat\ndesignation of origin\nDisclosure of information\nEnforcement\nevent\nFood\nFood Supplements\ngeographical indication\nHealth claims\nInformation\ninsurance\nnovel food\nNutrition claims\norganic\nreimbursement\nUncategorized\nGet informed\nCreated by Webfish.\nTweets by @FoodHealthLegal\nTimmers Promotions', 'urls': {'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1003', 'https://www.reclamecode.nl/uitspraken/vanille/voeding-en-drank-2018-00701-cvb/236039/', 'http://timmers-promotions.com', 'https://www.asa.org.uk/', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1011', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1024', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?page_id=7', 'https://www.optimel.nl/nl/c/vla/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoInnBRDDARIsANBVyARUH3Gzlg0G0ZaU_otRTitOvTAoI-J0WhkVff070j8Tgpf3QUdh3o8aAjaJEALw_wcB', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1028', 'https://werberat.de/content/english-keyfacts', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1036', 'https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011R1169&amp;from=NL', 'https://www.foodwatch.org/nl/foodwatchnl-de-voedselwaakhond/', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?page_id=32', 'http://www.webfish.se', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/vanille.jpg'}}, {'url': 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1011', 'content': 'Transparency vs. Confidentiality: EFSA’s new role as from March 2021 | Food Health Legal\nAbout the authors\nAbout this blog\n← Trends from Silicon Valley for meat alternatives\nVanilla custard or custard with vanilla taste? →\nTransparency vs. Confidentiality: EFSA’s new role as from March 2021\nPosted: July 31, 2019 | Author: Jasmin Buijs | Filed under: Authors, Food, Information, novel food\n|Comments Off on Transparency vs. Confidentiality: EFSA’s new role as from March 2021\nLast month, the European Council formally adopted the new Regulation on the transparency of the EU risk assessment in the food chain, which will be applicable as of 26 March 2021. As is in the name, the new provisions aim at increased transparency of EU risk assessment, which for a large deal means strengthening the reliability, objectivity and independence of the studies used by European Food Safety Authority (“EFSA”). As EFSA has been accused more than once of conflicts of interest, this is, in principle, a welcome development. For FBOs, the implications are however important – as will be demonstrated below.\nThe upcoming changes follow from the Commission Communication on the European Citizens Initiative on glyphosate, in which initiative EU citizens called for more transparency in scientific assessments and decision-making, and build upon the findings of the fitness check of the General Food Law. The new provisions will mainly amend the General Food Law. For reasons of consistency, the new provisions also introduce changes to eight legislative acts dealing with specific sectors of the food chain, including the Novel Food Regulation, the Additives Regulation and the GMO Regulation. Based on the publicly available proposal for the meanwhile adopted provisions on the transparency of EU risk assessment, this blogpost provides an overview of what applicants will be facing in authorization procedures for innovative food products in terms of transparency and confidentiality.\nPre-submission phase: union register of commissioned studies and general advice\nBefore submitting an authorization application, for instance for a Novel Food like cultured meat or insects or for a new additive, applicants will have to notify EFSA of any study they commissioned to support a future authorization application. These studies will become part of the union register of commissioned studies as managed by EFSA. The submitted studies will be made public only when an actual application follows and insofar the studies do not contain confidential information, regarding which a request for confidential treatment has been granted. The idea behind the union register is that companies (potentially) applying for an authorization submit all related information, which subsequently allows EFSA to cross-check the information on the studies performed. This way, applicants can no longer hold back unfavorable studies. This notification obligation also applies to laboratories in the EU that carry out those studies, but obviously not to non-EU laboratories as they fall outside the scope of new provisions. According to the EC’s fact sheet of 13 June 2019, consequences of non-compliance with the notification obligation shall result in a negative temporary stop in the risk assessment.\nAt the same time, applicants have the right to request EFSA for advice on the relevant provisions and the required content of the application for authorization in the pre-submission phase. This procedure is a response to industry demand, especially of SMEs, for further support in the preparation of applications. The advice shall, however, be provided without the input of the Scientific Panels that are in charge of the actual scientific assessment and shall not cover the specific design of a study. Furthermore, EFSA’s advice shall be made public. Based on the publicly available proposal for the transparency provisions, it seems that this\xa0will be done before an actual authorization application is being submitted.\nSubmission phase: citizens’ access to studies vs. confidentiality\nThe default setting under the new provisions is that all scientific data, studies and other information supporting applications for authorizations shall be made public by EFSA. While the new provisions aim at ensuring that stakeholders and the public have access to key safety related information being assessed by EFSA, duly justified confidentiality information shall not be made public. The new rules specify which types of information may be considered as such. As listed in the publicly available proposal, this includes production methods, the quantitative composition of the substance or product at stake, certain commercial relationships and other sensitive business information. It is the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate that making public the information concerned would significantly harms the (commercial) interests concerned. Only in very limited and exceptional circumstances relating to foreseeable health effects and urgent needs to protect human health, animal health or the environment, confidential information shall be disclosed.\nSpecific sectoral food legislation will also include a list of certain types of information that may be treated confidentially. For example, a proposed change to the GMO Regulation includes the specification that certain DNA sequence information and breeding patterns and strategies may be treated confidentially. Next to the confidentiality rules, existing intellectual property rights, data protection rights and data exclusivity provisions for proprietary data, remain applicable.\nWhen an applicant submits a request for confidentiality, it shall\nprovide a non-confidential version and a confidential version of the submitted information. If and when EFSA receives the submitted information, for example in case the Commission requires a scientific opinion as part of a novel food procedure, it shall publish the non-confidential version without delay and shall decide on the requested confidentiality within 10 days. Insofar the confidentiality request has not been accepted, EFSA shall subsequently publish the additional information after 2 weeks from the notification of its decision. Applicants that do not agree with EFSA’s decision may, under certain circumstances, challenge the decision before the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nOnce EFSA has published all the non-confidential information and before it carries out its scientific assessment, EFSA may consult third parties, including citizens, to identify whether other relevant information is available on the substance at stake. This new provision serves to mitigate the public concerns that EFSA’s assessment is primarily based on industry studies, more in particular on studies ordered by the applicant. The results of these consultations shall also be made public, as will be minority opinions to EFSA’s scientific output.\nRenewals\nIn case of a request for the renewal of an authorization, the applicant of the renewal will have the obligation to inform EFSA on its planned studies under the new rules. EFSA shall subsequently consult stakeholders and the public on the planned studies and, taking into account the received comments, provide the applicant with advice on the content of the intended renewal application. The reason behind this pre-submission procedure is to make use of the existing experience and knowledge on the substance or product in question. The European Commission expects that the notification obligation will have a positive effect on the evidence base of EFSA, avoids the unnecessary repetition of studies, and will provide the potential applicant with useful advice. It should, however, be noted that also in this case EFSA’s advice will not stand in the way of the subsequent assessment of the renewal application by the Scientific Panels.\nAdditional controls on the conduct of studies\nThe new provisions also include measures to ensure the quality and objectivity of the studies used by EFSA for its risk assessment. First of all, the European Commission will have the right to perform controls, including audits, to verify the compliance of testing facilities with relevant standards. Competent authorities of the Member States will be involved in these controls. Through coordination with OECD GLP auditing programs, the control in non-EU countries will be facilitated as well. Secondly, the European Commission will have the right to request EFSA to commission verification studies. Such action shall only be taken in exceptional circumstances, such as in case of serious controversies or conflicting results, and will be financed by the EU.\nConclusion\nThe new provisions address public concerns regarding transparency, while on the other hand acknowledge that confidentiality is key to not cut down on incentives for innovation by food businesses. In other words: the new provisions seek to balance transparency and confidentiality. Food businesses are advised to substantively consider their commercial interests when submitting a dossier for authorization, since confidentiality will only be granted upon duly justified requests. Moreover, the union register for submitted studies forces food businesses to carefully plan their studies at an early stage since also studies with less favorable outcomes will in principle be made public and scrutinized on inconsistencies with later studies. At the same time, more guidance is expected from EFSA in the pre-submission phase, possibly speeding up the actual authorization procedure. Given the fact that the new provisions will apply from less than 20 months from now, food businesses may consider speeding up or delaying their application for authorization, depending on their needs.\n← Trends from Silicon Valley for meat alternatives\nVanilla custard or custard with vanilla taste? →\nSearch for:\nRecent Posts\nLabeling and Advertising of Alternative Protein\nTowards 100 % recyclable or re-usable plastic food packaging in 10 years\nTrends from Silicon Valley for meat alternatives\nTransparency vs. Confidentiality: EFSA’s new role as from March 2021\nVanilla custard or custard with vanilla taste?\nCategories\nalternative protein\nAuthors\nbeauty claims\ncannabidiol\ncannabis\nclean meat\ndesignation of origin\nDisclosure of information\nEnforcement\nevent\nFood\nFood Supplements\ngeographical indication\nHealth claims\nInformation\ninsurance\nnovel food\nNutrition claims\norganic\nreimbursement\nUncategorized\nGet informed\nCreated by Webfish.\nTweets by @FoodHealthLegal\nTimmers Promotions', 'urls': {'https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018PC0179&amp;from=EN', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/conf1.png', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?page_id=7', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1028', 'https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/gfl_fitc_executive_summary_2018_en.pdf', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?page_id=32', 'http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-19-1031_en.htm', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1036', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1003', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/loop1.png', 'http://timmers-promotions.com', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1011', 'http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2017/EN/C-2017-8414-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1024', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/efsa1.png', 'http://www.webfish.se', 'https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2019/07/22/Sales-of-aspartame-should-be-suspended-EFSA-accused-of-bias-in-safety-assessment', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com', 'https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002R0178&amp;from=EN', 'https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003R1829&amp;from=EN'}}, {'url': 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1024', 'content': 'Trends from Silicon Valley for meat alternatives | Food Health Legal\nAbout the authors\nAbout this blog\n← Towards 100 % recyclable or re-usable plastic food packaging in 10 years\nTransparency vs. Confidentiality: EFSA’s new role as from March 2021 →\nTrends from Silicon Valley for meat alternatives\nPosted: October 2, 2019 | Author: Karin Verzijden | Filed under: Authors, clean meat, Food, novel food\n|Comments Off on Trends from Silicon Valley for meat alternatives\nWhat does the future of our meat look like? This topic was the subject of the Annual Conference of the Good Food Institute (GFI), which took place in San Francisco last month. GFI is an American non-profit organization that works with entrepreneurs, scientists and investors to make groundbreaking good food a reality. GFI focuses on the development of alternatives to animal products, consisting of plant-based products and products manufactured using cellular techniques (“cultured meat” or “cultured fish”).\nTrends from Silicon Valley also in EU\nThe issues raised at this conference are also relevant to Europe. In the Netherlands, for example, the Nutrition Centre advises that it is better for human health to have a more plant-based diet than has been the case until now. For example, the risk of cardiovascular disease would decrease if the diet included less meat and more wholegrain cereal products, legumes, vegetables, fruit and vegetable meat substitutes.\nGFI sessions: trending topics\nIn the country where the Beyond Meat citizen comes from, it was recognized that a large-scale breakthrough of meat alternatives has not yet taken place. The titles of the presentations were telling: “Marketing to Meat Eaters: How to Reach the Other 95 Percent of American Consumers“, “Capitalizing on Change: How Investors Accelerate the Plant-Based and Cell-Based Industries” and “Addressing the Key Challenges in Commercializing Cell-Based Meat“. \xa0Participants in the last session of the conference (“Cell-Based Meat Entrepreneurship“) were JUST and Memphis Meats, the companies that are said to be “closest to the market” with their cultured meat products. According to JUST, they will launch a cultured meat burger still this year. But that’s what they say every year.\nPlant-based meat substitutes in the US\nWhat is legally required to be able to market meat alternatives? Of course, it all starts with the name: what can you call these products? The basic rule, both in the US and in the EU, is that consumers must not be misled. In the case of plant-based products, this principle is applied in various ways in the United States. For example, the burger of Beyond Meat (which is now also available in the Netherlands) is simply referred to as the BEYOND BURGER and described as “the world’s first plant-based citizen that looks, cooks, and satisfies like beef…“. Impossible Foods also refers to its company name in its IMPOSSIBLE BURGER. This product is not yet on the market in the EU, partly because it contains a protein of which the regulatory status in the EU is not entirely clear (so-called leghomoglobin). This protein is obtained on the basis of fermented yeast, possibly using GMO techniques. Finally, Morning Star (“It easy eating green“), when selling its plant-based burgers, refers to the flavour-defining ingredient that they contain, for example “mediterranean chickpea burgers” and “spicy black bean burgers“. Confusion with conventional meat products does not seem to be an issue here.\nAnd what about the EU? Famous example of the Vegetarian Butcher\nIn the meantime, more and more plant-based meat substitutes are also being sold in the EU. One of the best-known examples of (alleged) confusion about product names in the Netherlands concerned the case of the Vegetarian Butcher, a company that was acquired by Unilever in December 2018. At the end of 2017, the Dutch Food Safety Authority (NVWA) asked this company to modify the labels of the products offering a substitute for tuna, chicken and bacon (all spelled with a twist in Dutch), because these would be misleading. It turned out afterwards that the criticism concerned only the information on the website. The NVWA apologised and the Vegetarian Butcher did not have to change any product labels.\nProposal for a ban on Vegaburger in the European Parliament\nThe next shockwave took place at European level when, in April of this year, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI Committee) of the previous European Parliament adopted a proposal to ban the use of meat names for plant-based products. On the basis of this proposal, it would no longer be possible to use the names ‘steak’, ‘sausage’, ‘ham’, etc. for plant-based products. A new European Parliament has now been elected. It has been reported from Brussels sources that the new AGRI Committee has taken the old proposal as a starting point for a working document. However, so many forces are working together against the previously envisaged ban that the chances of this happening are not considered to be very great. Arguments against this ban are that it would inhibit innovation in the EU, harm consumer rights and simply not be necessary: consumers are not so easily confused about plant-based meat substitutes. With the slogan “Stop the vegaburger ban“, Pro Veg launched a petition against this ban.\nCultivated meat in the US\nCurrently, about 30 companies active in the field of cultured meat worldwide. The companies that are most advanced with their innovations are located in the US. Menphis Meat, for example, focuses on the development of beef and poultry from the lab. This company has received investments from both well-known names (Bill Gates, Richard Branson) and from the “classic” meat industry (Tyson and Cargill). JUST focuses on the development of, among other things, chicken meat from the lab. The company has already launched an egg-free mayonnaise, that was the object of discussions with the FDA. According to the current product standard for mayonnaise, this product must contain eggs, otherwise it cannot be called “mayonnaise”. This problem was solved by changing the name of the product (“JUST Mayo”). How cultured meat will be named upon its market introduction is yet an open question. However, five companies have joined forces: they form the so-called Alliance for Meat Poultry and Seafood Innovation to approach the supervisory authorities with one voice. GFI has also developed a narrative framework to familiarise consumers with this technology and it published the results of market research into favorite names. For the time being, “cultivated meat” and “cultured meat” are at the top in terms of “appeal” and accuracy.\nCultured meat in the EU\nIn the EU, the question remains whether cultured meat can actually be called ‘meat’ at all. The number of arguments for and against is more or less balanced. We reported earlier on this topic in our blogs How do we get cellular ag products to the market and Regulatory pathways for clean meat in the EU and the US; not much progress has been made since that time. The main argument in favor is that when a product is identical to conventional meat at a molecular and nutritional level, producers want to be able to use this name as well. In addition, the use of the term ‘meat’ is very functional in terms of consumer orientation. Furthermore, there do not seem to be any direct legal objections to the use of ‘meat’ for cultured meat, since the Agricultural Products Standards Regulation does not contain a specific product standard for meat, unlike, for example, dairy products. Arguments against the use of ‘meat’ are based, among other things, on the Hygiene Regulation. This Regulation defines ‘meat’ as certain parts of a variety of animals, including bovine and porcine animals and poultry. It is questionable whether a product obtained from a single cell derived from one of these animals complies with this definition. Furthermore, the Hygiene Regulation refers in various places to the slaughter of farmed animals. Of course, slaughter does not apply to cultured meat – that’s the whole point. Finally, certain meat names are subject to specific regulations. In the Netherlands for example, the name ‘tartar’ may only be used for minced meat from cattle with a maximum fat content of 10 % based on specific Commodities Act legislation.\nConclusion\nThe future of our meat is taking shape. Plant-based meat substitutes are already on the market in large numbers and these products are getting more and more shelf space in the supermarket. The challenge for these products is to keep that shelf space. A certain amount of time will elapse before cultured meat will be available on a large scale on the shelf. It is expected that the first company will submit a request for Novel Food authorisation sometime next year. It will take about 18 – 24 months to complete such an authorisation procedure. By then we will have reached 2022. This may seem a long way off for the consumer, but the preparation by the producer has been a reality for a long time. Also, it was learned via the grapevine that EU-based cultured meat companies are getting organized.

And what does packaging mostly consist of? Of course: plastic! To date, only few other materials have proved as reliable for food packaging as plastic. At the same time, we know that plastic has many disadvantages for the environment. Read this blogpost to be informed on the most important initiatives of the food sector and on the legal tools of the European Commission in this field.\nThe visionary number of 2030\nBy 2030, all plastic packaging in the EU will be recyclable or re-usable. In other words, all plastic packaging will then be collected and transformed into new packaging materials, or can be used as such more once. This goal follows, amongst others, from the European Strategy for Plastics. It is a worthy endeavor, and for some it is not even ambiguous enough. The signatories of the Plastics Pact aim to achieve this result as early as 2025. Nestlé has also announced its ambition to make 100% of its packaging recyclable or re-usable by 2025. Since this year, Lipton bottles sold in the Netherlands are already made from 100% recycled plastic. The so-called European Single-use plastics Directive (Directive 2019/904) will soon be introduced to further promote recycling of plastics as one of the measures against disposable plastics. In the Netherlands, this Directive will be implemented by means of a General Administrative Order (in Dutch: Algemene Maatregel van Bestuur, or “AMvB”) before the Directive’s date of application on 3 July 2021. In this regard, an internet consultation will be launched this month to invite citizens, companies and institutions to make suggestions to improve the quality and feasibility of the current proposal.\nRecycled materials and articles\nThe encouragement to use recycled materials and articles in the EU for environmental reasons was already expressed in recital 24 of the European framework legislation on food contact materials (Regulation 1935/2004). However, food safety and consumer protection should not be neglected. Therefore, food packaging materials, including recycled plastics, should not endanger human health and not adversely affect the composition of foods or their sensory properties in an unacceptable way. The above-mentioned framework legislation leaves room for detailed rules on specific materials, and priority has been given to rules on recycled plastics. Their use has been increasing for a long time. Indeed, today’s sustainability initiatives cannot be imagined without the recycling of plastic food packaging. Moreover, diverging national legislation on this topic as a consequence of no harmonization at EU level would be highly undesirable.\nSpecific legislation\nSpecific rules on recycled plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foods can be found in Regulation 282/2008. Such rules are important because plastic packaging waste can be contaminated by residues from previous use, but also by contaminants from misuse and from non-authorized substances. In order to ensure that possible contamination is removed and that recycled plastics therefore do not adversely affect human health and foodstuffs with which they come into contact, an appropriate sorting and recycling process is essential. It should be noted that Regulation 282/2008 refers to mechanical recycling, which does not involve any significant change in the chemical structure of the plastic material. This process is less suitable for composites and multilayered plastics, which means that not all plastics are eligible for recycling under Regulation 282/2008.\nAuthorization procedure plastic recycling processes in a nutshell\nBefore a recycling process can be applied to plastics to create food packaging, the process must be approved by the European Commission. Such authorizations are process specific. This means that authorizations cover a specific recycling process used in a specific company by applying specific technologies and process parameters. Authorization holders are of course free to license out the authorized recycling process to other companies. Applications for the approval of recycling processes shall be submitted to the competent authority at Member State level. The European Commission published a list of contact points for competent authorities. In the Netherlands, applications can be submitted to the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (in Dutch: Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport, or “VWS”) and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (in Dutch, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, or “RIVM”).\nAs part of the application, a technical dossier is to be provided. This dossier will subsequently be subject to a safety assessment by EFSA, followed by a scientific opinion. In fact, here we very much see the parallel with the safety evaluations EFSA performs regarding for instance Novel Foods and additives. Topics to be covered to evaluate the safety of a particular recycling process include input characterization, description of the recycling process, determination of the decontamination efficiency of the recycling process, output characterization, and intended application in contact with food. For example, the dossier must demonstrate that and how it is ensured that the input material does not contain any chemical substances that could survive the recycling process and migrate to our foods in irresponsible quantities. In order to evaluate potential migration, detailed information on the type of food(s) intended to come into contact with the final product shall be provided. This will also include information on time, temperature and contact surface. Another important aspect concerns single or repeated use of the final product. All of this data serves to exclude possible health hazards and unacceptable influences on foods due to migration of substances. Further details can be found in the guidelines published by EFSA.\nAfter receipt of a valid dossier, EFSA has, in principle, six months to evaluate the dossier. Thereafter, it is up to the European Commission to take an authorization decision. In doing so, it will take into account EFSA’s scientific advice. The final authorization may be subject to conditions and/or restrictions, such as with regard to the plastic input, the recycling process and/or the field of application of the recycled plastic. Authorized recycling processes are listed in a Community register established by the European Commission.\n100% Recyclable\nMany companies like to inform consumers that the food packaging they use is made from recycled plastics. However, it is essential that consumers are not misled about, for example, the actual content of recycled plastics used. Companies are therefore advised to follow ISO 14021 on environmental labels and declarations, or equivalent rules. In addition, the Dutch Advertising Code Committee (in Dutch: Reclame Code Commissie, or “RCC”) also explains what is possible and what is not, such as regarding packaging made of recycled plastics being environmentally friendly or friendlier. Environmental claims, i.e. advertisements in which implicit or explicit reference is made to environmental aspects associated with the production, distribution, consumption or waste processing of goods or services, must be verifiable. For instance, communicating that an article is “good for nature” because of the material used is\xa0perceived as misleading when this statement cannot be checked. It is no problem to use environmental symbols, as long as there is no confusion about the symbol’s origin and meaning. Examples of this include the Mobius Loop accompanied by the percentage of recycled material used in or near the symbol, as well as Lipton’s variation thereof.\nConclusion\nWhile food business operators shall normally not be involved in the recycling of packaging themselves, they are advised to closely follow developments in this regard. Packaging namely plays an essential role in protecting foodstuffs and in providing information about the food it contains. Food business operators will therefore benefit from being aware of sustainable packaging possibilities. Moreover, food business operators can strengthen their legal position by being familiar with the legal requirements of the parties they cooperate with as well as with their own responsibilities set out by law. An example of the latter concerns making verifiable and non-misleading environmental claims, which is not always as easily done as said.\n← Labeling and Advertising of Alternative Protein\nTrends from Silicon Valley for meat alternatives →\nSearch for:\nRecent Posts\nLabeling and Advertising of Alternative Protein\nTowards 100 % recyclable or re-usable plastic food packaging in 10 years\nTrends from Silicon Valley for meat alternatives\nTransparency vs. Confidentiality: EFSA’s new role as from March 2021\nVanilla custard or custard with vanilla taste?\nCategories\nalternative protein\nAuthors\nbeauty claims\ncannabidiol\ncannabis\nclean meat\ndesignation of origin\nDisclosure of information\nEnforcement\nevent\nFood\nFood Supplements\ngeographical indication\nHealth claims\nInformation\ninsurance\nnovel food\nNutrition claims\norganic\nreimbursement\nUncategorized\nGet informed\nCreated by Webfish.\nTweets by @FoodHealthLegal\nTimmers Promotions', 'urls': {'https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0904&amp;qid=1588525457059&amp;from=NL', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?page_id=7', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1028', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?page_id=32', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1036', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1003', 'https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02004R1935-20090807&amp;qid=1588525474391&amp;from=NL', 'http://timmers-promotions.com', 'https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/safety/docs/cs_fcm_legis_recycling-processes_applications.pdf', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1011', 'https://europeanplasticspact.org/', 'https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02008R0282-20151026&amp;qid=1588525492427&amp;from=NL', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1024', 'https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/safety/docs/cs_fcm_auth_ref_en.pdf', 'https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.717', 'http://www.webfish.se', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com', 'https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2df5d1d2-fac7-11e7-b8f5-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF', 'https://www.lipton.nl/100procentgerecycled.html', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Schermafbeelding-2020-05-01-om-12.03.50.png', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Afbeelding1.png', 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Schermafbeelding-2020-05-04-om-12.34.57.png', 'https://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/nestle-recyclable-reusable-packaging-by-2025'}}, {'url': 'http://foodhealthlegal.com/?p=1036', 'content': 'Labeling and Advertising of Alternative Protein | Food Health Legal\nAbout the authors\nAbout this blog\nTowards 100 % recyclable or re-usable plastic food packaging in 10 years →\nLabeling and Advertising of Alternative Protein\nPosted: May 12, 2020 | Author: Karin Verzijden | Filed under: alternative protein, Authors, Food, novel food\n|Comments Off on Labeling and Advertising of Alternative Protein\nSneak peek of Vitafoods Protein Summit\nConsumers nowadays tend to include more and more plant-based products into their diet. For instance, a study ordered by DuPont Nutrition established double digits of growth for non-dairy ice-cream, dairy and cheese during the year preceding June 2018.\xa0 More recently, NPR published an overview demonstrating which products were most consumed during the corona crisis. Amongst these, plant-based meat alternatives and oat milk were the biggest hits, demonstrating over 200 and 300 % growth respectively. Plant-based alternatives for dairy and meat will be discussed during the Protein Summit of the Vitafoods Conference in Geneva. As you may know, this conference was shifted from May to early September. In anticipation thereof, a webinar on Protein and Protein Alternatives took place on 12 May. During this webinar, I covered the labeling and advertising of these products. This blogpost offers a recap of my contribution thereto, targeting those who are interested in this topic but could not assist.\nRegulatory requirements for market access\nObviously, there are other relevant aspects for alternative protein-based products than labeling and advertising, such as the regulatory requirements for market access. For some products, like those based on certain algae or on isolates from mung beans, most likely an authorization under the Novel Food Regulation will be required. This implies that the applicant will have to put together a product dossier demonstrating the safety of the product and submit this to the European Commission. This certainly applies for cultured meat products, unless they incorporate GMO steps in their production process and / or end product. In such case, market authorization will have to be obtained on the basis of the GMO Directive and the GMO Regulation. These topics will be dealt with during the Conference in September, detailing the scientific, economic and practical implications thereof.\nRelevant general labelling rules\nA number of labeling rules are of relevance for any food product, including those based on alternative protein. In fact, the cornerstone of labeling law, embodied in the Regulation on Food Information to Consumers, is the prevention of misleading. This can be done in various ways, but it is of the essence that at all times any confusion about the characteristics of a product is avoided. During the webinar, I brought up the example of Mylk to clarify this. Obviously, this is not a conventional dairy product, but a plant-based product. Do you think any confusion about the nature and / or the composition of this product could arise?\nThis should be decided based on the so-called Teekanne decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). According to this decision, it is prohibited to give the impression (by means of an image or a description) that a particular ingredient is present in a product, whereas this is not the case and the consumer can only find out when reading the list of ingredients. When this test is applied to the product Mylk, I am of the opinion it shall pass. Firstly, consumers will most likely not expect conventional milk, because of the twist in the product name. Secondly, FOP it states “dairy-free”. Thirdly, most plant-based dairy products are not stored in the fridge in the supermarket. Lastly, from the list of ingredients it is apparent this product is based on coconut cream.\nSector specific dairy legislation\nFor the dairy sector, important guidance was provided by the Tofutown decision by the ECJ. As detailed in an earlier blog post, we learnt from this decision that – in short – it is prohibited to use dairy names, such as “Tofubutter”, “Pflanzenkäse” and “Veggiecheese” for non-dairy products. This can be explained by the fact the dairy market is highly regulated, meaning that any specific dairy product has its own product standard. This standard should be met when manufacturing and marketing the product at stake. During the webinar, I mentioned the product standard for milk, defined as “normal mammary secretion obtained from one or more milkings without any addition thereto or extraction therefrom”. From this definition it follows why the use of the work milk in combination with a plant-based ingredient is, in principle, no longer allowed.\nHowever, there are always exceptions to the rules, also in this case. These exceptions relate to so-called traditional use, like “coconut milk” (UK) and “lait d’amande” (France). Those exceptions are mentioned on a list drawn up by the European Commission. Furthermore, the word “milk” and designations used for milk products (e.g. cream, butter, yoghurt) can be used in association with one or more words designating certain composite products (famous example: “chocolate milk”). A condition precedent however is that milk is an essential part thereof, either in terms of quantity or for characterization of the product, and no constituent takes the place of milk.\nPlant-based meat replacements\nFor these types of products, using (or not) the word “meat” is not so much an issue, because they are no conventional meat product. This issue is rather whether it is legally permitted to use certain meat product designations, such as “hamburger”, “sausage” and the like. In the US, we have seen so-called censorship bills in a great number of States. These are usually driven by the meat sector lobby, who fear unfair competition from their plant-based peers. There is fierce opposition against such censorship, amongst others from the Good Food Institute. Mid April, the GFI reported their lobby had been successful in Virginia, where the Governor vetoed label censorship.\nIn the EU, we have seen similar initiatives when the AGRI Committee of the European Parliament proposed a bill restricting the use of meat product names for meat alternatives. The status of this bill is yet undecided, as the current European Parliament that was inaugurated in 2019, did not yet vote on it. Fierce lobbying pro and con is however going on. We must therefore anticipate that if this bill turns into law, it will also result into restrictions of very popular terms. The alternatives for those popular terms are not so obvious yet: “lentil slices?” or “carrot tubes?”.\nPlease bear in mind that restrictions can also stem from national Member State laws based on reserved product designations. In the NL for instance, the name “minced meat” and “tartar” are such reserved product designations that can only be used for products meeting exactly the relevant legal specifications.\nComparative advertising\nWhen discussing the advantages of new over conventional protein products, certain advertising standards should be taken into account. In the EU, one of the ways to avoid misleading regarding your alternative protein product is to not emphasize certain characteristics that your product does not have. In this context, I discussed in the webinar a commercial that was made for BECEL margarine (FLORA in UK) that was shown both in the Netherlands and in Belgium. The text stated “Plants are the new cows. They are outside in the field whole year long. They provide seeds, that are a source of omega-3, which is good for your heart. BECEL is 100 % plant-based and good for your heart.”\nAccording to a complaint filed with the Dutch Advertising Code Committee (similar to Advertising Standards Authority in UK), the comparison made between plants and cows was misleading. Rationale: it was suggested that plants had a more positive effect on the environment than dairy products made from milk. The complaint was dismissed. The ACC considered that the commercial did not at all compare the advantages of plant-based products to the disadvantages of conventional dairy. In fact, it only stressed the positive health effects of BECEL, due to its plant-based ingredients. The commercial appeared an effective (and funny!) way of advertising alternative dairy products.\nTakeaway\nAlternative protein products are food products like any other, so make sure that when marketing these, you are up to speed with all applicable general labeling requirements. Furthermore, take into account any sector specific standards, like the ones that apply for dairy products. Also, please note that at Member State level, further restrictions on the use of particular product names may apply. Finally, when advertising these products, make sure to avoid any misleading and know the rules for comparative advertising. This will be of particular relevance, especially once further labeling standards will evolve at EU level as initiated by the AGRI Committee of the European Parliament. Stay tuned – we will.\nCopyright image: Nanne Meulendijks – please contact the artist for any further use.\nTowards 100 % recyclable or re-usable plastic food packaging in 10 years →\nSearch

BufferSubtopicsFitness - Nutrition ListDisability Loans & GrantsDisability Fitness : Nutrition and HealthDisabled World (disabled-world.com)Revised/Updated: Friday, 27th March 2020Synopsis and Key Points:Information on achieving and maintaining health, fitness level, and nutrition intake for people with disabilities in order to maintain strength, muscle mass, and healthy cardiovascular system.The escalating rate of workplace disabilities is causing businesses and consumers alike to revisit how they handle stress and health issues.When we keep our bodies active through a consistent exercise program, we are adding to our body\'s ability to metabolize food and keep weight down.Main DocumentIn the age which we live there is an unprecedented focus on getting and staying healthy. As more and more research points to the effect of fitness and nutrition on our overall health, the findings become more difficult to ignore. There is no doubt that the food that we eat and the physical activity that we perform significantly impact our weight and our body\'s overall health and longevity.Nutrition is defined as the intake of food, considered in relation to the body\'s dietary needs.\nGood Nutrition - An adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity, is a cornerstone of good health.\nPoor Nutrition - Can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity.\nThe diet of an organism is what it eats, which is largely determined by the availability, processing and palatability of foods. A healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation, heat or leaching, and that reduce risk of food-born illnesses.\nDiet and nutrition refers to the intake of food and nourishment for the growth and maintenance of the body. Dietitians or nutritionists consider a diet as a balanced meal that contains appropriate portions of all nutrients.\nA good diet helps a person to maintain good health.\nFitness is the overall well being of the human body.\nDiet and nutrition are therefore an important part of fitness.\nThe escalating rate of workplace disabilities is causing businesses and consumers alike to revisit how they handle stress and health issues.\nHigh stress, lack of exercise and other factors exacerbated by an aging U.S. workforce are contributing to an increase in the numbers of individuals receiving long-term disability payments each year, according to a new study from the Council for Disability Awareness.\nFitness and Nutrition Equal Good Health\nWhen we keep our bodies active through a consistent exercise program, we are adding to our body\'s ability to metabolize food and keep weight down. Further, good fitness means strong and limber muscles and a strong cardiovascular system. Exercise also lowers blood pressure and reduces stress levels.\nA wide variety of colorful nutritious food on display table - Photo by Dan Gold on Unsplash\nWhen you look at fitness and nutrition and the consequences of ignoring their importance, it is not difficult to see how large a role they play in our health. First and foremost, it is important to understand how powerfully diet can affect us. Natural, whole foods - such as fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins - give our bodies the vitamins that it needs to function effectively. We have energy when we eat right. And when we have energy we burn fat. Eating properly allows us to maintain a healthy weight and keep undue stress off of our heart; it also allows us to keep our blood pressure and cholesterol levels in the healthy range. Most importantly, good nutrition keeps our bodies stocked with antioxidants that fight off a range of illnesses including cancer.\nRegular exercise is one of the requirements necessary to address health and fitness issues. The types of exercises that will improve and strengthen the heart muscles are highly recommended.\nIf you spend long hours in a wheelchair you know it can lead to uneasiness and be very uncomfortable, which is true for anyone who is disabled. Keeping the body moving as much as possible in your wheelchair should be a regular part of your daily fitness program. This should be a priority no matter what your disability. Doing regular wheelchair exercise will help you increase your strength, flexibility, improve your mobility, strengthen your heart and lungs, and help you control your weight.\nKeep Body Moving\nBurn your excess fat and calories.\nMental stimulation and exercise can be incorporated to keep you mind sharp and sound.\nChallenge your mind to grow, expand, learn, explore, decipher, and experience.\nMeditation can reduce stress, heart rate, and blood pressure.\nResearchers studied 370 member of a runners club for people aged 50 years and older, and 249 community members who did not belong to the running club. They were between 50 and 72 years of age at the start of the 13-year study. The runners had far lower death rates, which was expected, and far less disability, such as osteoarthritis, which is impressive.\nBasic Nutrition Facts\nAdding Sugar is a Disaster.\nUnprocessed Food is Healthiest.\nThere is no Perfect Diet For Everyone.\nRefined Carbohydrates are Bad For You.\nEating Vegetables Will Improve Your Health.\nIt is Critical to Avoid Vitamin D Deficiency.\nSupplements Can Never Fully Replace Real Foods.\n"Diets" Don\'t Work, a Lifestyle Change is Necessary.\nOmega-3 Fats Are Crucial and Most People Don\'t Get Enough.\nArtificial Trans Fats Are Very Unhealthy and Should be Avoided.\nSubtopics and Associated SubjectsChildhood ObesityCooking TipsDieting and Diet PlansExercisingLongevityMetabolismNutritionVegetarianismRelated Information1 - Appetite Loss After Exercising Explained : Albert Einstein College of Medicine (2018/04/25)2 - Facial Exercises Proven to Help Women Appear Younger : Northwestern University (2018/01/04)3 - Old and New Food Pyramid Information and Pictures : Disabled World (2017/12/20)4 - What Happens When We Starve?

As more and more research points to the effect of fitness and nutrition on our overall health, the findings become more difficult to ignore. There is no doubt that the food that we eat and the physical activity that we perform significantly impact our weight and our body\'s overall health and longevity.Nutrition is defined as the intake of food, considered in relation to the body\'s dietary needs.\nGood Nutrition - An adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity, is a cornerstone of good health.\nPoor Nutrition - Can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity.\nThe diet of an organism is what it eats, which is largely determined by the availability, processing and palatability of foods. A healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation, heat or leaching, and that reduce risk of food-born illnesses.\nDiet and nutrition refers to the intake of food and nourishment for the growth and maintenance of the body. Dietitians or nutritionists consider a diet as a balanced meal that contains appropriate portions of all nutrients.\nA good diet helps a person to maintain good health.\nFitness is the overall well being of the human body.\nDiet and nutrition are therefore an important part of fitness.\nThe escalating rate of workplace disabilities is causing businesses and consumers alike to revisit how they handle stress and health issues.\nHigh stress, lack of exercise and other factors exacerbated by an aging U.S. workforce are contributing to an increase in the numbers of individuals receiving long-term disability payments each year, according to a new study from the Council for Disability Awareness.\nFitness and Nutrition Equal Good Health\nWhen we keep our bodies active through a consistent exercise program, we are adding to our body\'s ability to metabolize food and keep weight down. Further, good fitness means strong and limber muscles and a strong cardiovascular system. Exercise also lowers blood pressure and reduces stress levels.\nA wide variety of colorful nutritious food on display table - Photo by Dan Gold on Unsplash\nWhen you look at fitness and nutrition and the consequences of ignoring their importance, it is not difficult to see how large a role they play in our health. First and foremost, it is important to understand how powerfully diet can affect us. Natural, whole foods - such as fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins - give our bodies the vitamins that it needs to function effectively. We have energy when we eat right. And when we have energy we burn fat. Eating properly allows us to maintain a healthy weight and keep undue stress off of our heart; it also allows us to keep our blood pressure and cholesterol levels in the healthy range. Most importantly, good nutrition keeps our bodies stocked with antioxidants that fight off a range of illnesses including cancer.\nRegular exercise is one of the requirements necessary to address health and fitness issues. The types of exercises that will improve and strengthen the heart muscles are highly recommended.\nIf you spend long hours in a wheelchair you know it can lead to uneasiness and be very uncomfortable, which is true for anyone who is disabled. Keeping the body moving as much as possible in your wheelchair should be a regular part of your daily fitness program. This should be a priority no matter what your disability. Doing regular wheelchair exercise will help you increase your strength, flexibility, improve your mobility, strengthen your heart and lungs, and help you control your weight.\nKeep Body Moving\nBurn your excess fat and calories.\nMental stimulation and exercise can be incorporated to keep you mind sharp and sound.\nChallenge your mind to grow, expand, learn, explore, decipher, and experience.\nMeditation can reduce stress, heart rate, and blood pressure.\nResearchers studied 370 member of a runners club for people aged 50 years and older, and 249 community members who did not belong to the running club. They were between 50 and 72 years of age at the start of the 13-year study. The runners had far lower death rates, which was expected, and far less disability, such as osteoarthritis, which is impressive.\nBasic Nutrition Facts\nAdding Sugar is a Disaster.\nUnprocessed Food is Healthiest.\nThere is no Perfect Diet For Everyone.\nRefined Carbohydrates are Bad For You.\nEating Vegetables Will Improve Your Health.\nIt is Critical to Avoid Vitamin D Deficiency.\nSupplements Can Never Fully Replace Real Foods.\n"Diets" Don\'t Work, a Lifestyle Change is Necessary.\nOmega-3 Fats Are Crucial and Most People Don\'t Get Enough.\nArtificial Trans Fats Are Very Unhealthy and Should be Avoided.\nSubtopics and Associated SubjectsChildhood ObesityCooking TipsDieting and Diet PlansExercisingLongevityMetabolismNutritionVegetarianismRelated Information1 - Appetite Loss After Exercising Explained : Albert Einstein College of Medicine (2018/04/25)2 - Facial Exercises Proven to Help Women Appear Younger : Northwestern University (2018/01/04)3 - Old and New Food Pyramid Information and Pictures : Disabled World (2017/12/20)4 - What Happens When We Starve?

The phrase "eating a rainbow" of fruits and vegetables is a simple way of remembering to get as much color variety in your diet as possible, so that you can maximize your intake of a broad range of nutrients. The colors of fruits and vegetables are a small clue as to what vitamins and nutrients are included. By getting a variety of different colored fruits and vegetables, you are guaranteed a diverse amount of essential vitamins and minerals.\nTable 2: Color Classifications and Health Benefits\nColorsFruits & VegetablesPhytochemicalsVitamins & MineralsHealth BenefitsReferences\nGreen\nFruits:\nGreen Grapes, Limes, Green Pears, Kiwi, Chayote, Honeydew, Avocado, Green ApplesVegetables:\nAsparagus, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Celery, Greens, Collard Greens, Muster Greens, Turnip Greens, Spinach, Green Beans, Green Peppers, Cabbage, Zucchini, Packaged Salad Bags, Lettuce, Okra, Cucumbers\nLutein Glucosinolates Folate Isothiocyanates Vitamin K folic acid potassium chlorophyll Vitamin C\nPrevent macular degeneration, boost immune system, maintain healthy bones and teeth.\n(Heber 2004, Garden-Robinson 2009, Guitart, Pickering, and Byrne 2014, FNS 2016)\nRed\nFruits:\nCherries, Strawberries, Grapefruit, Watermelon, Blueberries, Plums, Red Grapes, Black Grapes, Red ApplesVegetables:\nBeets, Radish, Tomatoes, Red Peppers, Red Onions\nLycopene Anthocyanins Calcium Vitamin D Flavonoids Resveratrol Vitamin C Folates\nReduce tumor growth and cancer and stroke risk, Promotes memory function, healthy aging, heart, and prostate health.\n(Heber 2004, Garden-Robinson 2009, Joseph, Nadeau, and Underwood 2002, Brown 2016, FNS 2016)\nBlue\nPurple\nYellow\nFruits:\nApricots, Cantaloupe, Pineapple, Yellow Apples, Oranges, Tangerines, Peaches, Mango, Nectarines, LemonsVegetables:\nCarrots, Corn, Pumpkin, Yams, Squash, Yellow Peppers\nAlpha-Carotene Beta-Carotene Vitamin A Vitamin C folate\nPromote vision and immune system; reduce cancer risk, and heart disease.\n(PbhFoundation 2016b, Joseph, Nadeau, and Underwood 2002, Brown 2016, FNS 2016)\nOrange\nWhite\nFruits:\nBananas, Coconuts, Bosc PearsVegetables:\nPlantain, Cauliflower, White Onions, Mushrooms, Turnips, Russet Potatoes, Idaho Potatoes, Jicama, Yuca\nAllyl Sulfides Allicin Potassium\nPrevent certain cancers; maintain cholesterol levels.\n(Langtree 2005, Heber 2004, FNS 2016)\nWhat is Quercetin?\nFound in apples, onions and other citrus fruits, not only prevents LDL cholesterol oxidation, but also helps the body cope with allergens and other lung and breathing problems.\nWhat is Ellagic Acid?\nMainly found in raspberries, strawberries, pomegranates, and walnuts, has been proven in many clinical studies to act as an antioxidant and anticarcinogens in the gastrointestinal tract. This nutrient also has been proven to have an anti- proliferative effect on cancer cells, because it decreases their ATP production.\nThe best-known of the carotenoids, beta-carotene, is converted into vitamin A upon entering the liver. Although being known for its positive effects on eyesight, it has also been proven to decrease cholesterol levels in the liver.\nClinical studies have proven that lycopene, mainly found in tomatoes, may decrease the risk of prostate cancer, as well as protect against heart disease. Lutein, which is found in blueberries and members of the squash family, is important for healthy eyes. However, it does support your heart too, helping to prevent against coronary artery disease.\nAlong with the above stated nutrients, there are even more nutrients found in fruits and vegetables that provide a great deal of support to our body. Almost everyone has heard of vitamin C, which keeps our immune system strong; speeds wound healing, and promote strong muscles and joints. This nutrient is scattered throughout the spectrum of fruits, but commonly associated with oranges and other citrus fruits. Potassium, which is the nutrient most Americans are deficient in, does great things for our hearts, and lowers blood pressure.\nAnother good food component many people don\'t get enough of is fiber, found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\nWhat are Flavonoids?\nInclude anthocyanins, flavones, isoflavones, proantocyanidins, quercetin and more, are found almost everywhere. They are responsible for the colors in the skins of fruits and vegetables and help to stop the growth of tumor cells and potent antioxidants. They also can reduce inflammation.\nWhat is Beta-glucan?\nFound in mushrooms, stabilizes and balances the body\'s immune system by supporting white blood cells. EGCG is found in tea and has been shown to reduce the risk of colon and breast cancer. It boosts the immune system and encourages T-cell formation, which defends our body against sickness and disease.\nWhat are Bioflavonoids?\nFound in citrus fruits, are considered a companion to vitamin C because they extend the value of it in the body. These nutrients have the capabilities to lower cholesterol levels and support joint collagen in arthritis cases.\nThe number one excuse for not eating the required five servings of fruits and vegetables each day is they are too expensive. However, as compared to the amount of money spent on pre-packaged, processed, and fast foods, most fruits and vegetables (with the exception of those that are not in season) are not all that expensive.\nBecause frozen fruits and vegetables retain the majority of their nutritional value, they can be an excellent alternative when certain foods are out of season.\nSomeone who is not able to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables each day can also drink fruit and vegetable drinks in their place. Although this shouldn\'t become a habit, fruit and vegetable drink mixes can be an excellent substitute when you\'re rushed or traveling.\nThe need for fruits and vegetables in our diet is growing rapidly with the type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high cholesterol, hypertension that result from the "Typical American Diet" of fatty meats, processed sugars, and refined grains!\nFurther Information\nList of fruits and vegetables you can freeze\nList of healthy food you should be eating\nEat right with color - National Nutrition Month\nGrapefruit and medications don\'t mix\nPrintable Fruit and Vegetable Color Chart\n(Right click the chart below and select print.)\nPrintable fruit and vegetable color chart showing phytochemicals, vitamins and minerals, and the health benefits of each color.Related Documents1 - How Do I Possibly Eat All Those Fruits and Vegetables? : Disabled World (2017/12/10)2 - Study Finds Lutein May Counter Cognitive Aging : University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2017/07/25)3 - Color Chart of Healthy Fruits and Vegetables : Ian Langtree (2017/12/01)4 - Mangosteen a Natural Pain Relief for Fibromyalgia : Disabled World (2010/11/03)5 - Benefits of Cucumber for Healthy Skin and Eyes : Disabled World (2018/03/13)6 - How to Have a Healthy Face Skin Color : University of Nottingham (2011/01/11)7 - Shortfalls in Carotenoid Intake May Impact Women\'s Health : Weber Shandwick Worldwide (2010/10/05)Important:• Disabled World uses cookies to help provide and enhance our services to you and tailor some content and advertising.

Includes disability loans, grants, home ownership and mortgage guides, plus information on obtaining funds for accessible vehicles.Financial aid programs cover lending institutions for low income people in major countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and U.S.If you enter into a valid loan agreement, the value of the cash or item you receive is not income and does not reduce your Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit.Main DocumentIn these troubled times of COVID-19 we hope our list of loans and grants may be of some assistance to you. As we research legitimate specific Coronavirus stimulus payments, and low to no interest loans, both personal and business, we will either list them below or link to a new dedicated page from here.\nDue to the limited information currently available online in regards to reputable sources of disability loans and grants for the disabled, Disabled World has compiled an online resource of financial assistance programs available including grants for low income families as well as singles, the elderly, disabled students, and people with disabilities.Please Note: Disabled World does NOT provide loans, grants, or scholarships ourselves, but we do list helpful information and resources that may assist you to better source and navigate the online maze in order to obtain monetary assistance. The listed financial aid programs cover lending institutions for low income people in major world countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and the U.S.\nDefining Loans and Grants\nLoan DefinitionIn finance, a loan is a debt provided by one entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a note which specifies, among other things, principal amount, interest rate, and date of repayment. A loan entails reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower. Grant DefinitionNon-repayable funds or products disbursed by one party (grant makers), often a government department, corporation, foundation or trust, to a recipient, often a nonprofit entity, educational institution, business or an individual. In order to receive a grant, some form of Grant Writing often referred to as either a proposal or an application is required.\nHaving good credit can help you in a surprising number of ways. A good credit history can result in getting that dream job, lower interest rates on car loans and house mortgages, and aquire better rates on your insurance policies, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\nHome and Housing Finance Information and Calculators\nFirst Home Owners Guide to Mortgages\nHome Budget Calculator for Household Finances\nGuide to Home Buying for People with Disability\nOnline Loan Calculator\nDisability Housing and Home Loans\nSteps to Get Out of Debt\nCrowdfunding Legal Expenses\nHome Purchase or Rent: Pros and Cons Comparison\nIs Buying a House Cheaper Than Renting a Home?\nHome Improvement Loan and Grant Programs (U.S. Only)\nThe purpose of these loans and grants is to enable low-income homeowners to improve the safety and habitability of their homes. These home improvement programs can be implemented at the local, state, or federal levels and provide funding for low-income families to repair their houses, make home improvements, and/or remove health and safety hazards. These programs can be part of a broader home or housing improvement initiative or focused on specific issues such as heating and insulation, lead, or mold.\nHUD Approved Lenders\nFixing Up Your Home and How to Finance It\nHUD\'s Rehabilitation and Repair Loan\nHUD\'s Property Improvement Loan\nHome Improvement Loans for Native Americans\nRural Home Improvement and Repair Loans/Grants\nSingle Family Housing Repair Loans and Grants\nHelp with Home Repairs and House Modifications\nWeatherization Assistance Program\nHelp with Home Energy Bill (U.S.):\nThe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) may be able to help with:\nAssistance to pay your heating or cooling bills\nEmergency services in cases of energy crisis, such as utility shutoffs\nLow-cost home improvements, known as weatherization, and energy-related minor home repairs that make your home more energy efficient and lower your utility bills.\nNOTE: LIHEAP funds may not be used to pay water and sewer bills.\nU.S. Government Grants, Loans and Unclaimed Money\nListed below are various government loan programs available including grants for disabled people, low income home ownership, home mortgages, down payment loans, car and vehicle modification loans, personal loans, consolidation loans and college or education funding sources.\nGovernment Disability Grants\nFederal Domestic Assistance\nRural Development Loans\nFind the Right Loan for You\nFind and Apply for Government Grants\nBenefits and Gov. Assistance Eligibility\nFederal Housing Admin. (FHA) Loans\nUnclaimed Money from U.S. Gov.\nSmall Business Loans\nEmergency Assistance Funds\nEmergency Solutions Grants Program - ESG funds may be used for five program components: street outreach, emergency shelter, homelessness prevention, rapid re-housing assistance, and HMIS; as well as administrative activities (up to 7.5% of a recipient’s allocation can be used for administrative activities).\nSNAP Grants - Awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, SNAP grants provide funding for the repair and rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing of eligible, special-needs individuals, who can qualify for the grants based on age, disabilities, income and other eligibility standards.\nU.S. Department of Social Security Emergency Loans\nPhoto shows a persons left hand holding a pen and filling in a loan application.\nIn the U.S. The Department of Social Security can grant you an emergency loan of the equivalent to one month\'s benefits entitlement if you appear to qualify for disability through SSI\'s presumptive disability program (presumptive means something that is assumed to happen or assumed to be true). However, U.S. Social Security makes emergency payments to disability applicants only under some very specific circumstances, only those who can prove extreme hardship, e.g. a lack of food or housing, can qualify for the advance payment. This loan is not free money or a grant, it must be paid back from your presumptive disability checks from SSI.\nThe state in which you reside may also have an Interim Assistance (IA) program if you are likely to qualify for SSI. In order to receive a loan through this program you will have to sign what is known as an interim assistance reimbursement agreement, which means you guarantee to pay back this assistance amount from your Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit payments.\nNOTE: The Interim assistance (IA) program is usually administered by your state\'s public assistance, welfare agency, or department of social services.\nU.S. Supplemental Security Income Expedited Benefit Payments\nIf your claim is for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for disability or blindness, Social Security may make presumptive disability (PD) or presumptive blindness (PB) payments for up to 6 months while you are waiting for the Disability Determination Services (DDS) to make a final decision. Their decision to grant you PD or PB payments is based on the severity of your condition, the evidence available at the time, and the high likelihood that your claim will be ultimately approved, and is not based on your financial need.\nThe U.S. Department of Social Security MAY be able to make an emergency advance payment to new applicants, who face a financial emergency and are due SSI benefits that are delayed or not received. They will only pay one such advance payment - https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-expedite-ussi.htm\nSocial Security Compassionate Allowance Conditions List - Compassionate allowances are a way of quickly identifying diseases and other medical conditions that clearly qualify for Social Security and Supplemental Security Income disability benefits. The compassionate allowances list allows the U.S. Department of Social Security to make speedy decisions for the most obviously disabled individuals. If a claimant has a condition on the Compassionate Allowance list the SSA can approve their disability in as little as 10 days, with limited medical information which proves their diagnosis.\nCan Getting a Loan Affect My SSI Benefit?\nIf you enter into a valid loan agreement, the value of the cash or item you receive is not income and does not reduce your Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit. However, any funds that you may borrow - which you do not spend in that month - will count toward your SSI resource limit the next month - (https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-loans.htm)\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (Food Stamps)\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or, \'SNAP,\' which was called, \'food stamps,\' in the past assists people with low-incomes to purchase food. While it is a program through the federal government, it is run by state and local agencies.\nAnyone may apply for SNAP although a person and others in their household need to meet specific conditions. Everyone who is applying in a household needs to have or apply for a Social Security number and must be either a United States citizen, a U.S. national, or have status as a qualified alien. Further information regarding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\nHousing Grants for Disabled Veterans\nVeterans Affairs (VA) provides grants to Service-members and Veterans with certain permanent and total service-connected disabilities to help purchase or construct an adapted home, or modify an existing home to accommodate a disability.

receive from someone that you agree to pay for at a\nlater date.\nYou can make the loan agreement with a lending institution such as a\nbank, or an individual, such as a friend or relative.\nYou can make it orally\nor in writing, but it must be enforceable under State law.\nA loan can be:\ncash;\nfood; or\nshelter items (rent, mortgage, utility bills, etc.).\nHOW DOES A LOAN AFFECT MY SSI BENEFIT?\nIf you enter into a valid loan agreement, the value of the cash or item you receive is not income and does not reduce your Supplemental\nSecurity Income (SSI) benefit.\nHowever,\nany funds that you borrow which you do not spend in that month will count toward your SSI resource limit of $2,000 for an individual (or $3,000 for a couple) the next month.\nIf you lend money to someone else, the money they owe you may be a countable resource and may affect your eligibility for SSI.\nDOES INTEREST ON A\nLOAN COUNT AS INCOME FOR SSI?If you lend money to someone else, and we count the loan agreement as a resource, then we do not count the interest you receive as income.\nTHIS INFORMATION IS GENERAL.FOR MORE INFORMATION, CALL 1–800–772–1213 (TTY 1–800–325–0778),\nVISIT OUR

Our\ndecision to grant PD or PB payments is based on the severity of your condition, the evidence\navailable at the time, and the high likelihood that your claim will be\nultimately approved, and is not based on your financial need.\nWe will base the amount of these payments on your countable income.\nSee our chapter on SSI INCOME for an explanation of countable income.\nYou may be eligible to receive SSI benefits right away on the basis of a PD or PB determination if you have one or more of the following medical conditions:\namputation of a leg at the hip;\nallegation of total deafness; that is, no sound perception in either ear;\nallegation of total blindness; that is, no light perception in either eye;\nallegation of bed confinement or immobility without a wheelchair, walker, or crutches, due to a longstanding condition excluding recent accident and recent surgery;\nallegation of stroke (cerebral vascular accident) more than three months in the past and continued marked difficulty in walking or using a hand or arm;\nallegation of cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, or muscular atrophy and marked difficulty in walking (for example the use of braces), speaking, or coordination of the hands or arms;\nallegation of Down syndrome;\nallegation of intellectual disability\nor another neurodevelopmental impairment (for example, autism spectrum\ndisorder) with complete inability to independently perform basic self-care\nactivities (such as toileting, eating, dressing, or bathing) made by another person\nfiling on behalf of a claimant who is at least 4 years of age;\na\nchild has not attained his or her first birthday and the birth certificate or\nother medical evidence shows a weight below 1,200 grams (2 pounds, 10 ounces)\nat birth:\na child has not attained his or her first birthday and available medical evidence shows a gestational age (GA) at birth with these corresponding birth-weights:\n- GA: 37-40 weeks; weight at birth:\n2000 grams (4 pounds, 6 ounces) or less;\n- GA: 36 weeks; weight at birth: 1875 grams (4 pounds, 2 ounces) or less;\n- GA: 35 weeks; weight at birth: 1700 grams (3 pounds, 12 ounces) or less;\n- GA: 34 weeks; weight at birth: 1500 grams (3 pounds, 5 ounces) or less; or\n- GA: 33 weeks; weight at birth: at least 1200 grams, but no more than 1325 grams\n(2 pounds, 15 ounces)\xa0or less;\n- GA:\n32 weeks; weight at birth; at least 1,200 grams (2 pounds, 10 ounces), but less\nthan 1,325 grams (2 pounds, 15 ounces);\nsymptomatic\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome (AIDS); Form SSA-4814-F5 or SSA-4815-F6 is needed;\na physician confirms by telephone or in a signed statement that an individual has a terminal illness with a life expectancy of six months or less; or a physician or knowledgeable hospice official (for example, hospice coordinator, staff nurse, social worker or medical records custodian) confirms that an individual is receiving hospice services because of a terminal illness;\nallegation of a spinal cord injury\nproducing an inability to ambulate without the use of a walker or bilateral\nhand-held assistive devices for more than two weeks with confirmation of such\nstatus from an acceptable medical source;\nallegation of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)\nrequiring chronic dialysis and the file contains a completed CMS-2728-U3 (End\nStage Renal Disease Medical Evidence Report-Medicare Entitlement and/or Patient\nRegistration); or\nallegation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) known as Lou\xa0Gehrig\'s\xa0disease.\nIf we are not able to make a PD or PB determination, sometimes the DDS will make a PD or PB determination based on one of the medical conditions listed above, or on the basis of another severe condition, if a final approval seems likely.\nWHAT HAPPENS TO PRESUMPTIVE DISABILITY OR BLINDNESS PAYMENTS IF WE LATER DENY YOUR SSI?\nWe do not ask you to repay these PD or PB payments, even if you are later found not to be disabled or blind.\nHowever, if you received an overpayment for other\nreasons, (for example, excess income, SGA, or resources), we may ask you to\nrepay some of the PD or PB payments.\nEMERGENCY ADVANCE PAYMENT\nWe may be able to make an emergency advance payment to new applicants, who face a financial emergency and who are due SSI benefits that are delayed or not received.\nWe can only pay one such advance payment. The maximum emergency advance payment you may receive is the smallest of:\nthe SSI Federal benefit rate (plus any federally administered State supplement);\nthe total amount of the benefits due; or\nthe amount requested for the financial emergency.\nWHO CAN RECEIVE AN EMERGENCY ADVANCE PAYMENT?\nPeople who are due SSI benefits (including PD or PB payments) that are delayed or not received; and\nAre facing a "financial emergency"––which means they need money right away due to a threat to health or safety, such as not enough money for food, clothing, shelter or medical care.\nHOW DO WE RECOVER AN EMERGENCY ADVANCE PAYMENT?\nWe will subtract the emergency advance payment from the payments already due you and pay you the difference.\nIf you are not due past payments, we will subtract the emergency advance payment from your current monthly benefits in up to 6\xa0monthly installments.\nIMMEDIATE PAYMENT\nWe may be able to make an immediate payment to new applicants and those already receiving SSI\nwhose benefits are delayed or not received and who face a financial emergency.\nThe immediate payment cannot be higher than $999.00.\nWHO CAN RECEIVE AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT?\nPeople who are initially applying for SSI benefits, or already receiving benefits; and\nAre due SSI benefits (including PD or PB payments) that are delayed or not received; and\nAre facing a "financial emergency"––which means they need money right away due to a threat to health or safety, such as not enough money for food, clothing, shelter or medical care.\nHOW DO WE RECOVER AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT?\nWe will subtract the immediate payment from the first regular payment due to you.\nThe decision to issue an immediate payment is up to us.\nYou do not have formal appeal rights if we decide you are not eligible for any of these payments.\nEXPEDITED REINSTATEMENT (EXR)\nIf your benefits ended because you worked and had earnings, you can request to have your benefits started again without having to complete a new application.\nWe call this process "expedited reinstatement".\nYou can request that your benefits start again if you:\nstopped receiving benefits because of earnings from work;\nare unable to do substantial gainful activity because of an impairment(s) that is the same\nas or related to the impairment(s) that allowed you to get benefits earlier; and\nmake the request within five\xa0years from the month your benefits ended.\nIn order to reinstate your benefits under this provision we need updated medical information for the DDS to make their determination.\nA Social Secuirty representative will assist you with all the necessary forms.\xa0\xa0If we approve your request for expedited reinstatement of your SSI benefits, your provisional (temporary) benefits will begin the month after your request.\nYou may be eligible for Medicaid coverage.\nWe can give you provisional benefits for up to 6\xa0months while we determine whether you can get benefits again.\nThese benefits include Federal payments and Medicaid coverage.\nIf we decide that you cannot get benefits again, we usually will not ask you to repay the provisional benefits.\nBack\xa0\xa0\xa0Top\xa0\xa0Next\nBenefits\nRetirement\nDisability\nMedicare\nSurvivors\nSSI\nResources\nOnline Services\nFAQs\nContact Us\nForms\nGlossary\nPublications\nAgency\nAbout Us\nAccessibility\nFOIA\nGuidance\nOpen Government\nPlain Language\nPrivacy\nConnect with Us\nBlog\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYouTube\nAll Social Media\nRelated Websites\nBenefits.gov\nMyMoney.gov\nRegulations.gov\nUSA.gov\nReport Fraud, Waste or Abuse\nOffice of the Inspector General\nThis website is produced and published at U.S. taxpayer expense.\nProtect Yourself from Social Security Scams\n×\nScammers are pretending to be government employees.\nLearn how to protect yourself and report scams.\nwww.ssa.gov', 'urls': set()}, {'url': 'https://www.nhs.uk/live-well', 'content': "Live Well - NHS\nSkip to main content\nMenu\nSearch\nSearch the NHS website\nSearch\nClose search\nMenu\nClose menu\nHome\nHealth A-Z\nLive Well\nCare and support\nHealth news\nServices near you\nHome\nBack to Home\nLive Well\nAdvice, tips and tools to help you make the best choices about your health and wellbeing.\nEat well\nAll you need to know about the major food groups and a healthy, balanced diet\nHealthy weight\nCheck your BMI using our healthy weight calculator and find out if you're a healthy weight\nExercise\nProgrammes, workouts and tips to get you moving and improve your fitness and wellbeing\nSleep and tiredness\nFind out how to sleep well and the common lifestyle factors that are making you tired\nSexual health\nEverything you need to know about sexual health, including contraception, STIs and good sex\nAlcohol support\nFind out the health benefits of reducing your alcohol intake and get tips on cutting down\nQuit smoking\nLearn about the benefits of quitting smoking, including better health and increased fertility\nHealthy body\nGet some practical information and advice for keeping your body in tip-top health\n5 steps to mental wellbeing\nPractical advice to help you feel mentally and emotionally better\nSupport links\nNHS sites\nAbout us\nContact us\nProfile editor login\nSitemap\nAccessibility\nOur policies\nCookies\n© Crown copyright", 'urls': set()}, {'url': 'https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/business-and-enterprise/regulation/food-safety/food-information-regulations', 'content': "Food information regulations | Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea\nHomeServices\nServices\nBenefitsBins and recyclingBirths, deaths, marriages and citizenshipBusiness and enterpriseChildren and education\nCommunity and local lifeCouncil TaxCouncil, councillors and democracyEnvironmentGrenfell Response and Recovery\nHealth and Social CareHousingJobsLeisure and cultureLibraries\nLicensingNew residentsParking, transport and streetsPlanning and Building Control\nClose menuPay onlineReport a problemNews\nAccessibilityMyRBKC Sign inMyRBKC Register\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) updates: We're here to help.\nGet the latest information on our response to Coronavirus, Council Service updates and support for residents and local businesses.\nRead more\nHomepage\nBusiness and enterprise\nFood information regulations\nFood information regulations\nThe Food Information Regulations and EU Food Information for Consumer Regulations (EU FIC)The Food Labelling Regulations 1996 have been replaced by the EU Food Information Regulation 1169/2001 (FIR). This legislation came into force on 13 December 2011.The main requirements are detailed in the Food Information Regulations 2014 and this includes an annex covering general and more specific changes to nutrition labelling which are covered in the Food Information for Consumer Regulations (FIC).These new regulations apply to all food businesses supplying food to the public and caterers, including retail premises, manufacturers, restaurants, delicatessens, bakeries, sandwich bars, supermarkets, caterers, take-aways, buffets, and home caterers. There are some exemptions for example private individuals providing food for events such as church, village or school fetes where there is no food business element.Compliance dates1 January 2014 – For the rules on the composition and labelling of minced meat13 December 2014 – For the general labelling rules, and if provided, a nutrition declaration must use the format set out in the EU FIC from this date13 December 2016 – For the rules on the mandatory nutrition declaration needed for most pre-packaged foodsThe essentialsMuch of what is detailed in the current Food Labelling Regulations 1996 remains unchanged.\xa0There is no change in the fundamental principles of providing safe food which is honestly described and not misleading. In addition foods cannot be labelled to state they will prevent, treat or cure a human disease. The following information must be required in English on prepacked food labelling:A true name or description of the foodThe ingredients it contains, in descending weight orderHow it should be handled, stored, cooked or preparedWho manufactured, packed or imported itOrigin information if its absence would misleadAllergenic ingredients identified on the labelSpecific information declaring whether the food is irradiated or contains genetically modified material or aspartame, high caffeine, sweeteners, packaging gases etcNet quantity in grams, kilograms, litres etcAlcoholic strength where there is more than 1.2% alcohol by volumeMain changesAllergensBusinesses will need to provide information if any of the foods/ingredients detailed in the EU Regulations and indicated below are used in the preparation of food they supply. This information can be provided on labels, shelf-edge, menus or verbally if requested by the customer.The 14 ingredients or products thereof causing allergies or intolerances are:Cereals containing gluten (wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt, kamut), Crustaceans, Molluscs, Eggs, Fish, Peanuts, Soybeans, milk (including lactose), Nuts, Celery, Mustard, Sesame Seeds, Lupin and Sulphur Dioxide and Sulphites (at concentrations of more than 10mg/kg)If the food is non-pre-packed such as in a restaurant or café then the information about allergens can be supplied on the menu, on chalk boards, tickets or provided verbally by an appropriate member of staff as well as in other formats made available to the consumer. It must be clear and conspicuous, not hidden away, easily visible, and legible. If the information is to be provided verbally by a member of staff then it is necessary to make it clear that the information can be obtained by asking a member of staff by means of a notice, menu, ticket or label that can easily be seen by customers.Allergen information must be specific to the food, complete and accurate. This also applies to foods prepacked for direct sale such as from deli counters or sandwich bars.Refusal to give information, inaccurate or incomplete information about allergenic ingredients used in foods sold non-prepacked or pre-packed for direct sale would be a breach of the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulations.Irradiated foodsFoods that are treated with ionising radiation must be labelled with the words ‘irradiated’ or ‘treated with ionising radiation’ as stated in Directive 1999/2/EC. Where an irradiated product is used as an ingredient in another product, the same words must accompany its designation in the list of ingredients.AdditivesFood additives (and enzymes) which are used as processing aids do not generally have to be listed as ingredients.The name of a foodThe name of the food is not required under the European legislation but may be required by UK provisions. Where there is a name laid down by law this must be used. If not, a customary name may be used. If there is no customary name, or it is not used, a descriptive name must be used. The name of a food may consist of a name, a description, or both.Additional changes affecting pre-packed foodAllergen labelling for pre-packed foodAllergens listed in the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulations 1169/2011 must be declared in the ingredients list on prepacked food and emphasised through a different font, style etc. If it is not obvious from the name of the ingredient, there needs to be a clear reference to the name of the allergen next to it. E.g. stock (from fish)’, couscous (wheat)’, ‘tahini (sesame)’, casein (milk), and tofu (soya)Allergen ingredients must not be repeated elsewhere on the labelling, however sign posting to the allergen information within the ingredients list is allowed.\xa0 For example, the use of ‘Contains’: followed by a list of allergens will no longer be permitted. Voluntary statements highlighting the risk of cross contamination with allergens may still be used.Example of a label indicating ingredients and allergens:Ingredients: Figs (35%), barley, flakes, toasted and malted oat flakes (oat flakes, barley malt extract), toasted and malted wheat flakes (wheat, barley malt extract), nuts (8%) (brazil nuts, whole hazelnuts) oat flakes, wheat flakes, sunflower seeds (2%)! allergy advicePlease see ingredients for allergens.May contain other nuts and milkNutritional labellingFrom 13 December 2016 all prepacked food must be labelled with nutrition information which must be in a set prescribed format (commonly referred to as “back of pack” or “traffic light “nutrition labelling). This comprises energy values (in kilojoules (Kj) and kilocalories (kcal)) plus the amounts (in grams (g)) of fat, saturates, carbohydrate, sugars, protein and salt.Previously nutritional information was only required where a claim was made such as ‘low in fat’.Even if you already provide this information you may need to amend your labelling as the legislation requires this information to be provided in a prescribed order and the salt content is now required rather than sodium.There are some exceptions and specific requirements and these are detailed in the Annex of The Food Information Regulations 2014.\nFood Information Regulations 2014\nPDF\n273.32 KB\nDownload\nField of vision requirementsA minimum font size has been set for all mandatory information; the height of the letter ‘x’ in the chosen font must not be less than 1.2mm.\xa0The field of vision requirements no longer include durability. Only the name of the food, net quantity and alcoholic volume need to be able to be read by the consumer from a single view point.Distance selling requirementsAll mandatory information must be provided both before the purchase is concluded (except for durability date) and at delivery and at no additional cost. So if a Food Business Operator (FBO) is making the information available through a telephone helpline then this number must be a free-phone line.Commercial sellingFormerly food supplied between some businesses was exempt from labelling requirements. However, now everyone in the supply chain must ensure mandatory information is available on the food labelling or on documents such as invoices so that those further down the supply chain can meet their obligations.LanguageFood information must be given in English, however, it can also be provided in other languages.Name of the foodWhere there is a name laid down by law this must be used.\xa0If not a customary name may be used.\xa0If there is no customary name, or it is not used, a descriptive name must be used.\xa0The name of a food may consist of a name, a description or both. In the case of some foods, there are compulsory product names that must be used for foods meeting certain composition criteria.The name of food has always needed to include a reference to the physical condition or treatment the food has undergone such as ‘powered’, ‘dried’, ‘smoked’, ‘concentrated’ etc.\xa0This has now been extended to include an indication if the food has been defrosted.The word ‘formed’ must be used when meat or fish products have been made from different pieces of meat and yet have the appearance of a whole piece of meat.Name of the businessThe FBO whose name appears on the labelling is the business responsible for the information on the label.\xa0This must be a FBO in the EU or, where the food is imported into the EU, the importer into the EU.Country of originSome of the origin labelling provisions have yet to be agreed.\xa0These will be subject to the Commission report.The origin or place of provenance of a food must be given if it misleads consumers by its absence.County of origin labelling has now been extended to the meat of pigs, sheep, goats and poultry.\xa0Beef, fish, honey, olive oil, fresh fruit and vegetables already require this.FreezingThe date of first freezing is required on meat and fishery products.Minced meatEuropean compositional standards and additional labelling requirements are required for prepacked minced meat. If you are selling only in the UK different rules apply and a ‘national’ mark must be used.\xa0This was a requirement from 1 January 2014.Animal/vegetable fats and oilsThe source of any animal or vegetable oil or fat ingredient must be provided and displayed in the ingredients list e.g., palm oil, beef fat.\xa0If hydrogenated fats are used a full description must be used such as ‘fully or partly hydrogenated.’What do I need to do?As a Food Business Operator you need to know how the legislation will affect your business and you need to start making plans now so that you comply in time.Detailed food labelling legislation\xa0information can be found on the European Commission website.Further guidance\nFood Information Regulations 2014\nPDF\n273.32 KB\nDownload\nGuide to creating a front of pack nutrition label for pre-packed products sold through retail outlets\nPDF\n1.01 MB\nDownload\nAllergy and Tolerance: guidance to businesses\nTown Hall, Hornton Street, W8 7NX\n© 2020 The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea\nContact us\nTerms of use\nAccessibility\nData Protection\nCookies and your privacy", 'urls': {'http://food.gov.uk/business-industry/guidancenotes/allergy-guide/', 'http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/labelling_nutrition/labelling_legislation/index_en.htm'}}, {'url': 'http://food.gov.uk/business-industry/guidancenotes/allergy-guide/', 'content': 'Allergen guidance for food businesses | Food Standards Agency\nSkip to main content\nGoogle Tag Manager\nEnglishCymraeg\nOpen mobile navigation\nFood Standards Agency - Frontpage\nContactFood hygiene ratings\nSearch terms\nSubmit search\nLeave this field blank\nClose mobile navigation\nFood Standards Agency - Frontpage\nSearch\nSearch terms\nSubmit search\nLeave this field blank\nContactFood hygiene ratings\nHome\nNews and alerts\nNews and alerts\nBack\nNews and alerts\nLatest updates\nLatest updates\nBack\nNews\nFood Alerts\nSubscribe to news and alerts\nRSS feeds\nOpen policy making\nOpen policy making\nBack\nConsultations\nFood safety and hygiene\nFood safety and hygiene\nBack\nFood safety and hygiene\nAt home\nAt home\nBack\nCooking your food\nChilling\nCleaning\nCross-contamination\nHome food fact checker\nBuying and eating food\nBuying and eating food\nBack\nAllergy and intolerance\nBest before and use-by dates\nFood hygiene rating\nFood safety for community cooking and food banks\nFood crime\nFood poisoning\nFood poisoning\nBack\nCampylobacter\nListeria\nSalmonella\nHepatitis E virus\nE.

Staff can complete our free food allergy training. Managers can also share our allergen checklist with staff for tips on food allergy best-practice.\nWe have separate guidance for food manufacturers\xa0and institutional caterers.\n14 allergens\nFood businesses need to tell customers if any food they provide contain any of the listed allergens as an ingredient.\nConsumers may be allergic or have intolerance to other ingredients, but only the 14 allergens\xa0are required to be declared as allergens by food law.\nThe 14 allergens are: celery, cereals containing gluten (such as barley and oats), crustaceans (such as prawns, crabs and lobsters), eggs, fish, lupin, milk,\xa0molluscs (such as mussels and oysters), mustard, peanuts, sesame, soybeans, sulphur dioxide and sulphites (if they are at a concentration of more than ten parts per million) and tree nuts (such as almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios and macadamia nuts).\nThis also applies to additives, processing aids and any other substances which are present in the final product.\nAllergen labelling for different types of food\nThere are a number of ways in which allergen information can be provided to your customers. You will need to choose the method which is best for your business and the type of food you serve.\nPrepacked foods refer to any food put into packaging before being placed on sale, while non-prepacked food (loose food) is unpackaged food. Different allergen labelling rules apply depending on how the food is provided.\nOur technical guidance\xa0provides a detailed explanation of the labelling requirements for each food type.\nPrepacked\nPrepacked products refer to any food put into packaging before being placed on sale. Food is prepacked when it:\nis either fully or partly enclosed by the packaging\ncannot be altered without opening or changing the packaging\nis ready for sale.\nPrepacked food must have an ingredients list present on the packaging. Allergens present in the product must be emphasised each time they appear in the ingredients list.\nPrepacked for direct sale\nPrepacked for direct sale products are foods that have been packed on the same premises from which they are being sold.\nCommon foods that can fall into this category include sandwiches, salads and pies made and sold from the premises in which they are made. It is expected that the customer is able to speak with the person who made or packed the product to ask about ingredients.\nCurrently, allergen information can be provided in the same way as for non-prepacked (loose) foods.\nFrom October 2021, the way food businesses must provide allergen labelling information for Prepacked for Direct Sale (PPDS)\xa0will change. Foods will need to have a label with a full ingredients list with allergenic ingredients emphasised within it.\nThese changes will provide essential information to help people with a food allergy or intolerance make safe food choices.\nNon-prepacked (loose) foods\nIf you provide non-prepacked foods, you must supply allergen information for every item that contains any of the 14 allergens.\nNon-prepacked (loose) foods include:\nfoods sold loose in retail outlets\nfoods which are not sold prepacked.\nNon-prepacked allergen information requirements can apply to loose items sold at a delicatessen counter, a bakery, a butcher’s, as well as meals served in a restaurant, and food from a takeaway.\nFree-from, gluten-free and vegan claims\nMaking free-from claims for foods requires strict controls of ingredients, how they are handled and how they are prepared. A free-from claim is a guarantee that the food is suitable for all with an allergy or intolerance.\nFor example, if you are handling wheat flour in a kitchen and you cannot remove the risk of cross-contamination through segregation by time and space, you should let the customer know. You should not make any gluten-free or wheat-free claims.\nThe Food and Drink Federation provides specific information and guidance on free-from and gluten-free claims.\nCustomers sometimes assume that vegan meals are free-from animal based allergens (egg, fish, crustaceans, molluscs, milk). This is not always the case as low-level cross-contamination from these ingredients can occur during the production process. You need to be clear about this risk in the food you provide.\nThe Food and Drink Federation provides specific information and guidance on allergen-free and vegan claims.\nAllergen information for different types of food businesses\nHow you provide allergen information to customers will depend on the type of food business. Food business staff can learn more about providing allergen information by completing our free food allergy training and by using our allergen checklist.\nFood businesses\nYou must provide allergen information in writing if you sell or provide food to your customers directly. This could be either:\nfull allergen information on a menu, chalkboard or in an information pack\na written notice placed in a clearly visible position explaining how your customers can obtain this information\nWhen allergen information is provided as part of a conversation with a customer, this can be backed up by written information. This would ensure that it is accurate and consistent.\nYou can display this allergy and intolerance sign\xa0to tell customers how they can find allergy information, or create your own.\nBuffets\nIf you offer food in the form of a buffet, you need to provide allergen information for each food item separately. You should not provide it for the buffet as a whole.\nYou can provide this information by labelling the allergens contained in individual dishes, or by displaying a sign directing customers to ask staff for allergen information.\nThis information must be visible, clearly legible and easily accessible to the customer.\nFood delivery and takeaway food\nIf food is sold online or by phone through distance selling, allergen information must be provided at two stages in the order process.\nYou must provide allergen information:\nbefore the purchase of the food is completed - this can be in writing (on a website, catalogue or menu) or orally (by phone)\nwhen the food is delivered - this can be in writing (allergen stickers on food or an enclosed copy of a menu) or orally (by phone).\nAllergen information should be available to a customer in written form at a point between a customer placing the order and taking delivery of it.\nTakeaway meals should be labelled clearly so customers know which dishes are suitable for those with an allergy.\nAllergen requirements and best-practice for food businesses\nIt is important to manage allergens effectively in your food business to ensure food is safe for customers with food allergies.\nThis involves including allergen information when menu planning and having good food preparation and hygiene practices in place to avoid cross-contamination in your kitchen.\nDetailed guidance on how to manage allergens in the kitchen can be found in our Safer food, better business\xa0information packs for caterers.\nWe provide free food allergy training on best practice for managing allergens. You can also share our allergen checklist with staff.\nAllergen ingredient recording\nYou need to make sure that you know what is in the food you provide. You can do this by recording allergen ingredient information in a written format. Allergen ingredients information should be:\nrecorded on product specification sheets\nincluded on ingredients labels and ingredients should be kept in original or labelled containers\nincluded in recipes or explanations of the dishes provided – you need to consider the impact when recipes change\nup to date.\nWe have allergen ingredient templates and other training resources which may be useful in allergen planning your menu.\nAvoiding allergen cross-contamination\nIt is important for food businesses to take steps to avoid cross-contamination in food preparation to protect customers with a food allergy.\nThere are a number of actions you can take to prevent cross-contamination with allergens. These include:\ncleaning utensils before each usage, especially if they were used to prepare meals containing allergens\nwashing hands thoroughly between preparing dishes with and without certain allergens\nstoring ingredients and prepared foods separately in closed and labelled containers\nkeeping ingredients that contain allergens separate from other ingredients\nAllergen cross-contamination can also happen through using the same cooking oil. To cook gluten-free chips, you can’t use the same oil which has been previously used for cooking battered fish.\nIf you can’t avoid cross-contamination in food preparation, you should inform customers that you can’t provide an allergen-free dish.\nThe Food and Drink Federation provides specific information and guidance on free-from and gluten-free claims.\nEnforcement and penalties\nApart from the possibility of making a customer seriously ill, you could also face the risk of financial and reputational damage to your food business if you fail to comply with allergen information requirements.\nLocal authorities enforce allergen information regulations. Failure to comply can result in action from the local authority.\nIf you fail to act on advice given by the local authority, an improvement notice may be issued. If you do not meet the requirements of this notice, you will be issued with a penalty.\nYou have 14 days to appeal an improvement notice from the date the notice was issued. In some cases businesses may also face prosecution.\nBack to top\nRelated content\nAllergen labelling\nHow businesses need to label anything containing allergens in their food products.\nAllergy training for food businesses\nOnline food allergy training and e-learning resources for food businesses.\nAllergy and intolerance\nWhat food allergy is and what allergen information food businesses must provide to you.

On these cases, control authorities transmit follow-up notifications on measures taken and outcome of investigations. These follow-up notifications do not appear in the RASFF portal database.\nImportant notice concerning re-use of RASFF notifications\nLinks to the RASFF Portal website may be created only under specific conditions.\nRASFF disclaimer\nInformation on notifications fields in RASFF database\n"Notification type"\nThe "notification type" field, appearing in the "notification detail" window, consists of three parts:\nproduct type: "food", "feed" or "food contact material"\nnotification classification: "alert", "information", "border rejection"\nnotification basis, indicating what type of control, report or investigation lay at the basis of the notification:\nborder control – consignment released: notification initiated through a sample taken at a border post for analysis but the consignment was meanwhile released to the market;\nofficial control on the market: official control on the EEA internal market;\ncompany own-check: notification initiated through a company notifying the outcome of an own-check to the competent authority;\nconsumer complaint: notification initiated through a consumer lodging a complaint with the competent authority;\nfood poisoning: reports of a food poisoning leading to the notification of a risk in a food on the market that has caused the food poisoning.\n"Action taken"\nThis field represents the action already taken or to be taken by the notifying country at the time of notification. If "no action taken" is given for an alert notification, this normally indicates that the product is not on the market of the notifying country (therefore: no action taken by the notifying country) but it may be on the market of other member countries.\n"Distribution status"\nThis field indicates knowledge existing at the time of notification about the possible distribution of the product on the market. The concept "market" is to be interpreted in a geographical way: "the European Economic Area (EEA) market" i.e. this does not necessarily mean that the product is already on the shelves available to consumers, as often it is not.\n"Origin"\nThe "origin" field gives the available information regarding the origin of the product(s) concerned, this does not suggest that the hazards found originated there.\nRelated Links\nInformation note on EU measures concerning the illegal use of fipronil on some poultry farms (10 August 2017)\nAccess the RASFF portal\nAccess the RASFF Consumers\' Portal\nRASFF video presentation\nRelated Documents\n2018 RASFF annual report - NEW\nCountry fact sheets 2018\nQ&A Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed\nRASFF Infographic - NEW\nHistory of RASFF as a timeline\nHow does RASFF work\nRASFF information leaflet\nRASFF Portal user manual\nRASFF disclaimer\nRegulation (EC) No 178/2002\nQuick links\nQuick links\nRapid Alert for Food and Feed (RASFF)\nHealth and food audits and analysis\nEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA)\nBetter Training for Safer Food (BTSF)\nE-News\nPress Releases\nEvents\nVideos\nInfographics and factsheets\nFood Fraud\nFood Safety\nFollow us:Twitter\nDG Health and Food Safety\nEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission website\nFollow the European CommissionFacebook\nTwitter\nOther social media\nEuropean UnionEU institutions\nEuropean Union\nAbout the Commission\'s new web presence\nResources for partners\nCookies\nPrivacy Policy\nLegal notice\nBrexit content disclaimer\nContact', 'urls': {'https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety_en', 'https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff/country-fact-sheets_en'}}, {'url': 'https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff/country-fact-sheets_en', 'content': "Country fact sheets | Food Safety\nSkip to main content\nHome - European Commission\nSearch this websiteSearch\nHome\nFood, farming, fisheries\nFood Safety\nFood\nRASFF - Food and Feed Safety Alerts\nFood\nCountry fact sheets\nBrowse this section\nRASFF - Food & Feed Safety Alerts\nRASFF portal\nRASFF consumers' portal\nHow does RASFF work\nImplementing Regulation and Guidance\nMembers of RASFF network\nCountry fact sheets\nReports and publications\nFipronil incident\nAll Topics\nCountry fact sheets\nThe country fact sheets available for RASFF member countries give a picture of their activity in the RASFF.

There is no molten lava or lava glow to see anywhere in or out of the park.\nVisit our keyboard shortcuts docs for details\nDuration:7 minutes, 30 seconds\nIn 2018, a new eruption of Kīlauea volcano changed the island of Hawai‘i forever. From May through August, large lava flows covered land southeast of the park destroying over 700 homes and devastating residential areas in the Puna District. At the same time, the summit area of the park was dramatically changed by tens of thousands of earthquakes, towering ash plumes, and a massive collapse of Kīlauea caldera.\nThe body of water in Halemaʻumaʻu crater (USGS Photo/M. Patrick)\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) Now Tracks Water at the Summit of Kīlauea\nOn August 1st, 2019, USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) scientists confirmed a growing pond of water inside Halema'uma'u crater during a helicopter overflight. Similar to the monitoring of ponded lava in Halema‘uma‘u in 2008‒2018, HVO scientists are now relying on both direct observations and modern tools to monitor and document any changes to the water.\nThe water in Halema‘uma‘u is not visible from publicly accessible areas of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park, but HVO now has webcams that provide a direct view of the pond.\nTo measure the level of water in the lake, HVO scientists use a long-range laser rangefinder.\nWater samples indicate that the lake has a pH of 4.2 (moderately acidic, in the range of many fruit juices) and high concentrations of dissolved sulfur and magnesium. The depth of the lake is approximately 35 meters (115 feet) and growing. It is approximately 107 meters (~351 feet) wide by 211 meters (~692 feet) long. The water has a temperature of about 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit).\nCurrent Conditions Courtesy USGS - Hawaiian Volcano Observatory\nThursday, June 25th, 2020\nKīlauea caldera (NPS Photo/A. LaValle)\nKīlauea\nCurrent Alert Level: Normal\nActivity Summary: Kīlauea volcano is not erupting. Monitoring data for the month of May show variable but typical rates of seismicity and ground deformation, low rates of sulfur dioxide emissions, and only minor geologic changes since the end of eruptive activity in September 2018.\nFor more current monitoring info about Kīlauea, see: https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/status.html\nFull moon over Mauna Loa (NPS Photo/J.

In today’s world, where one of the most-talked about prospects for collapse is an epidemic of infectious disease, it is worth remembering that perhaps we already have the technological strategy to avoid it — the Internet.Remote working, made possible by the Internet (‘telepresence’), is already a key component of national and business pandemic plans. Telepresence can inhibit viral transmission by reducing human-to-human contact. Prepared organizations can leverage telepresence to allow continued productivity and functioning of supply chains during an outbreak.\nHe explores these ideas as well in his Long Now talk in April 2010, in which he talked about Six Easy Steps to Avert the Collapse of Civilization. Here’s an excerpt from that talk covering telepresence and telemedicine. Both videos have had under a thousand views so far. When you watch this remember that it was April, 2010!\nThis is the topic of his new book, The Safety Net: Surviving Pandemics and Other Disasters.\nCategories\nAsides\nFollow-up Questions from\xa0WCEU\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nJune 5, 2020\n39 Comments on Follow-up Questions from\xa0WCEU\nMatias and I just finished up the discussion and Q&A for the online WordCamp Europe that is going on right now, which was originally happening in Porto.\nThere were more good questions than we had time to get to, so at the end I suggested that we continue the conversation here, in the comments section!

I had experimented with using a Sony camera and capture card for the virtual event we did in February when WordCamp Asia was canceled, but that Trevor Noah video and exchanging some tweets with Garry Tan sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole, even after I was on-record with The Information saying a simpler setup is better.\nThe quality improved, however something was still missing: I felt like I wasn’t connecting with the person on the other side. When I reviewed recordings, especially for major broadcasts, my eyes kept looking at the person on the screen rather than looking at the camera.\nThen I came across this article about the Interrotron, a teleprompter-like device Errol Morris would use to make his Oscar-winning documentaries. Now we’re onto something!\nIllustration by Steve Hardie\nFor normal video conferencing a setup this nice is a distraction, but if you’re running for political office during a quarantine, a public company CEO talking to colleagues and the press, here’s a cost-is-no-object CEO livestreaming kit you can set up pretty easily at home.\nGEAR GUIDE\nElgato Cam Link 4K\nMicro HDMI Cable\nRetractable 3.5mm audio cable\nElgato Key Light Air LED panel\nIkan Elite Generation 2 Universal Large Tablet Teleprompter\nECM-B1M Shotgun Microphone\nSony α7R IV Camera\nSony – FE 16-35mm F2.8 GM Wide-angle Zoom Lens\nUltimate Ears UE 18+ Pro: In-ear monitors\nGonine NP-FZ100 AC Power Adapter\nReticam mini tripod\n13″ portable monitor\nBasically what you do is put the A7r camera, shotgun mic, and the lens together and switch it to video mode, go to Setup 3, choose HDMI settings, and turn HDMI Info Display off —\xa0this gives you a “clean” video output from the camera. You can run off the built-in battery for a few hours, but the Gonine virtual battery above lets you power the camera indefinitely. Plug the HDMI from the camera to the USB Camlink, then plug that into your computer. Now you have the most beautiful webcam you’ve ever seen, and you can use the Camlink as both a video source and an audio source using the shotgun mic. Put the Key Light wherever it looks best. You’re fine to record something now.\nIf you’d like to have a more two-way conversation Interrotron style, set up the teleprompter on the tripod, put the camera behind it, connect the portable monitor to your computer (I did HMDI to a Mac Mini) and “mirror” your display to it. (You can also use an iPad and Sidecar for that.) Now you’ll have a reversed copy of your screen on the teleprompter mirror. I like to put the video of the person I’m talking to right over the lens, so near the bottom of my screen, and voilà! You now have great eye contact with the person you’re talking to. The only thing I haven’t been able to figure out is how to horizontally flip the screen in MacOS so all the text isn’t backward in the mirror reflection. For audio I usually just use a headset at this point, but if you want to not have a headset in the shot…\nUse a discreet earbud. I love in-ear monitors from Ultimate Ears, so you can put one of these in and run the cable down the back of your shirt, and I use a little audio extender cable to easily reach the computer’s 3.5mm audio port. This is “extra” as the kids say and it may be tricky to get an ear molding taken during a pandemic. For the mic I use the audio feed from the Camlink, run through Krisp.ai if there is ambient noise, and it works great (except in the video above where it looks a few frames off and I can’t figure out why. On Zoom it seems totally normal).\nHere’s what the setup looks like all put together:\nAfter that photo was taken I got a Mac Mini mount and put the computer under the desk, which is much cleaner and quieter, but used this earlier photo so you could see everything plugged in. When you run this off a laptop its fan can get really loud.\nAgain, not the most practical for day to day meetings, but if you’re doing prominent remote streaming appearances—or if your child is an aspiring YouTube star—that’s how you can spend ~9k USD going all-out. You could drop about half the cost with only a minor drop in quality switching the camera and lens to a Sony RX100 VII and a small 3.5mm shotgun mic, and that’s probably what I’ll use if I ever start traveling again.\nIf I were to put together a livestreaming “hierarchy of needs,” it would be:\nSolid internet connection (the most important thing, always)Audio (headset mic or better)Lighting (we need to see you, naturally)Webcam (video quality)\nWe’ve put together a Guide to Distributed Work Tools here, which includes a lot of great equipment recommendations for day-to-day video meetings.\nTags\ndistributed work, livestreaming\nCategories\nWordPress\nCelebrate\xa0Seventeen\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nMay 27, 2020\n28 Comments on Celebrate\xa0Seventeen\nMay 27th, 17 years ago, the first release of WordPress was put into the world by Mike Little and myself. It did not have an installer, upgrades, WYSIWYG editor (or hardly any Javascript), comment spam protection, clean permalinks, caching, widgets, themes, plugins, business model, or any funding.\nThe main feedback we got at the time was that the blogging software market was saturated and there wasn’t room or need for anything new.\nWordPress did have a philosophy, an active blog, a license that protected the freedom of its users and developers, a love of typography, a belief that code is poetry, fantastic support forums and mailing lists and IRC, and firm sense that building software is more fun when you do it together as a community.\nWe have relentlessly iterated across 38 major releases since then, and here we are.\nIf you’d like to celebrate with me, put on some jazz, eat some BBQ, light a candle for the contributors who have passed on, help a friend or stranger less technical than you build a home online, and remember that technology is at its best when it brings people together.\nCategories\nFuture of Work\nGradually, Then\xa0Suddenly\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nMay 21, 2020\n22 Comments on Gradually, Then\xa0Suddenly\nThe two main theses of my professional career have been that distributed is the future of work, and that open source is the future of technology and innovation. I’ve built Automattic and WordPress around these, and it’s also informed my investments and hobbies. Just today, we announced an investment into a distributed, open source, and encrypted communication company called New Vector.\nOn the distributed front, the future of work has been arriving quickly. This week, a wave of companies representing over $800B in market capitalization announced they’re embracing distributed work beyond what’s required by the pandemic:\nCoinbase is going remote-first.Facebook wants to be “the most forward-leaning on remote work.”Twitter has allowed permanent work-from-home.Shopify is now a “digital by default” company.Square has indefinitely extended remote work.Spotify is allowing work-from-home through 2021.\nChange happens slowly, then all at once.\nThe forces that enable working in a distributed fashion have been in motion for decades, and if you talk to anyone who was working in technology in the ’60s and ’70s they expected this to happen much sooner. Stephan Wolfram has been a remote CEO for 28 years. Automattic has been distributed-first for 15 years.\nWhat’s been holding us back is fear of the unknown, and attachment to the familiar. I can’t tell you how many of the investors I see espousing distributed work once told me that Automattic would never scale past a few dozen people unless we brought everyone into an office. Or the CEOs who said this would never work for them, now proclaiming their company hasn’t missed a beat as tens of thousands of people started working from home.\nWhat’s going to be newsworthy by the end of the year is not technology companies saying they’re embracing distributed work, but those that aren’t. Those who thought this couldn’t work have been forced by the pandemic to do it anyway, and they’ve now seen that it’s possible.\nIt was probably terrible at first, but now two or three months in it’s gotten better. We’ve learned and adapted, and will continue to do so. Necessity breeds invention. I promise you if you stick with it, you’ll progress through the levels of distributed autonomy. Over time people will be able to move houses, tweak furniture, buy equipment, upgrade their internet, and otherwise adapt to being more productive in a distributed environment than they ever could be in an office. Products and services are being developed all around the world that will make it even better. I’m so excited about how a majority of the economy going distributed will improve people’s quality of life, and unlock incredible creativity and innovation at work. (They go hand in hand.)\nAt some point, we’ll break bread with our colleagues again, and that will be glorious. I can’t wait. But along the way we’ll discover that things we thought were impossible were just hard at first, and got easier the more we did it. Some will return to physically co-working with strangers, and some employers trapped in the past will force people to go to offices, but the illusion that the office was about work will be shattered forever, and companies that hold on to that legacy will be replaced by companies who embrace the antifragile nature of distributed organizations.\nTags\ndistributed work\nCategories\nAsides\nTulsa Remote Worker\xa0Experiment\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nApril 27, 2020\n1 Comment on Tulsa Remote Worker\xa0Experiment\nSarah Holder at Citylab has an interesting article on a program that paid people $10,000, a year of co-working, and a subsidized apartment to move to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nTraditionally, cities looking to spur their economies may offer incentives to attract businesses. But at a time when Americans are\xa0moving less frequently\xa0than they have in more than half a century, and the anticlimactic race to host an Amazon HQ2\xa0soured some governments on corporate tax breaks, Tulsa is one of several locales testing out a new premise: \xa0Pay\xa0people\xa0instead.\nI love this idea, and hope that after the permanent step-up in remote work from the virus we see much more internal mobility between cities in the United States.\nCategories\nFuture of Work\nDistributed Work’s Five Levels of\xa0Autonomy\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nApril 10, 2020\n4 Comments on Distributed Work’s Five Levels of\xa0Autonomy\nI recently had the opportunity to sit down with Sam Harris, author and host of the Making Sense podcast, for a wide-ranging conversation. Given the moment we’re currently living through, we naturally touched on the way companies are adapting to a new reality — one where remote work is a model to which they must adapt in a matter of days, rather than years.\nAs I mentioned to Sam on the podcast, “any company that can enable their people to be fully effective in a distributed fashion, can and should do it far beyond after this current crisis has passed.” It’s a moral imperative. But that doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy, or that the chaotic and stressful first taste some workplaces are getting right now is one that inspires them to keep trying.\nTo make sense of this journey — from a company’s cautious exploration of remote possibilities to a fully realized distributed experience — I like to think of how it plays out through the concept of levels of distributed work, which I modeled after self-driving car levels of autonomy. I’ve seen some solid recaps of my conversation with Sam from Steve Glaveski and Steve Jurvetson, but here’s my gist of how distributed companies evolve:\nLevel Zero autonomy is a job which cannot be done unless you’re physically there. Imagine construction worker, barista, massage therapist, firefighter… Many companies assumed they had far more of these than it has turned out they really did.The first level is where most colocated businesses are: there’s no deliberate effort to make things remote-friendly, though in the case of many knowledge workers, people can keep things moving for a day or two when there’s an emergency. More often than not, they’ll likely put things off until they’re back in the office. Work happens on company equipment, in company space, on company time. You don’t have any special equipment and may have to use a clunky VPN to access basic work resources like email or your calendar. Larger level one companies often have people in the same building or campus dialing into a meeting. Level one companies were largely unprepared for this crisis.Level two is where many companies have found themselves in the past few weeks with the COVID-19 pandemic. They’ve accepted that work is going to happen at home for a while, but they recreate what they were doing in the office in a “remote” setting, like Marshall McLuhan talked about new media mediums initially copying the generation before. You’re probably able to access information from afar, you’ve adapted to tools like Zoom or Microsoft Teams, but everything is still synchronous, your day is full of interruptions, no real-time meetings have been canceled (yet), and there’s a lot of anxiety in management around productivity — that’s the stage where companies sometimes install surveillance software on laptops. Pro tip: Don’t do that! And also: Don’t stop at level two!At the third level, you’re really starting to benefit from being remote-first, or distributed. That’s when you see people invest in better equipment — from a good desk lamp to solid audio gear — and in more robust asynchronous processes that start to replace meetings. It’s also the point at which you realize just how crucial written communication is for your success, and you start looking for great writers in your hiring. When you are on a Zoom, you often also have a Google Doc up with the other meeting participants so you can take and check real-time notes together. Your company has a zero-trust BeyondCorp security model. In a non-pandemic world you plan meetups so teams can break bread and meet each other in person a week or two a year.Level four is when things go truly asynchronous. You evaluate people’s work on what they produce, not how or when they produce it. Trust emerges as the glue that holds the entire operation together. You begin shifting to better — perhaps slower, but more deliberate — decision-making, and you empower everyone, not just the loudest or most extroverted, to weigh in on major conversations. You tap into the global talent pool, the 99% of the world’s population and intelligence that doesn’t live near one of your legacy physical office locations. Employee retention goes way up, and you invest more in training and coaching. Most employees have home-office setups that would make office workers green with envy. You have a rich social life with people you choose. Real-time meetings are respected and taken seriously, almost always have agendas and pre-work or post-work. If you get good at baton passes work will follow the sun 24/7 around the world. Your organization is truly inclusive because standards are objective and give people agency to accomplish their work their way.Finally, I believe it’s always useful to have an ideal that’s not wholly attainable — and that’s level five, Nirvana! This is when you consistently perform better than any in-person organization could. You’re effortlessly effective. It’s when everyone in the company has time for wellness and mental health, when people bring their best selves and highest levels of creativity to do the best work of their careers, and just have fun. 🤠\nA highly influential book for me in designing Automattic was Daniel Pink’s Drive, where he eloquently introduces the three things that really matter in motivating people: mastery, purpose, and autonomy. Mastery is the urge to get better skills. Purpose is the desire to do something that has meaning, that’s bigger than yourself. These first two principles physically co-located companies can be great at. But the third, autonomy, is where even the best in-office company can never match a Level 4 or above distributed company.\nAutonomy is our desire to be self-directed, to have agency over ourselves and our environment. Close your eyes and imagine everything around you in a physical office: the chair you’re in, the desk, distance from a window, the smells, the temperature, the music, the flooring, what’s in the fridge, the comfort and privacy of the bathrooms, the people (or pets) around you, the lighting. Now imagine an environment where you can choose and control every one of those to your liking — maybe it’s a room in your house, a converted garage, a shared studio, or really anything, the important thing is you’re able to shape the environment fit your personal preferences, not the lowest common denominator of everyone an employer has decided to squish together for 8 hours a day. The micro-interactions of the hundreds of variables of your work environment can charge you and give you creative energy, or make you dependent, infantilized, and a character in someone else’s story. Which do you want to spend half of your waking workday hours in?\nFor a good summary of Dan Pink, check out this animation. The other books I referenced in the podcast are Geoffrey West’s Scale and Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Antifragile.\nMy talk with Sam covered many other topics, from communicating in distributed companies to the challenges businesses are facing due to COVID-19, so I hope you head over and listen to the rest or stream it on Youtube.\nTags\ndistributed work\nCategories\nFuture of Work\nDon’t Mute, Get a Better\xa0Headset\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nMarch 24, 2020\n23 Comments on Don’t Mute, Get a Better\xa0Headset\nOne heterodox recommendation I have for audio and video calls when you’re working in a distributed fashion is not to mute, if you can help it. When you’re speaking to a muted room, it’s eerie and unnatural —\xa0you feel alone even if you can see other people’s faces. You lose all of those spontaneous reactions that keep a conversation flowing. If you ask someone a question, or they want to jump in, they have to wait to unmute. I also don’t love the “unmute to raise your hand” behavior, as it lends itself to meetings where people are just waiting their turn to speak instead of truly listening. I’m always hesitant to disagree with Seth Godin, but that’s been my experience.\nSo what should you do? Use the latest and greatest hardware and software to have the best of both worlds, a fantastic auditory experience for you and your interlocutors and little to no background noise.\nTo summarize, I recommend a wired, USB headset with a mic that stays a constant distant from your mouth and has a noise-canceling microphone. Save mute for coughs and sips of drinks.\nThe rest of this post I’m going to try out eleven different microphones and headsets, ranging from $35 to $1,000+, and record a short file on each, and intersperse some software tips for people on MacOS.\nYou may want to listen to these samples with good headphones on to really hear the differences. I apologize some are louder than others, I didn’t edit to even out the levels, which Zoom or Skype would do automatically.\nMy previous top recommendation was the trusty Sennheiser SC 30, in my previous bag posts. It’s cheap and effective, but the cord was too long and it was USB-A. If you read no further, get this one and revolutionize how you sound on Zoom calls. Here’s how it sounds:\nSennheiser has upgraded to a USB-C version, with a much shorter cord, the SC 130. It feels and looks much better, you don’t need a USB-C dongle, and the sound quality of the earphones is quite bearable. The cost is about twice as much (~$70).\nYou can plug the USB-C into your iPad or Android phone as well and it works great, though the headphones can be a bit quiet on Android. Either of the above will spoil you for making calls, and you won’t want to go back to the old low-fi way of doing things.\nIn order to have a bit more flexibility I tried out the much more expensive ($134) Sennheiser MB Pro 1. I liked the freedom of wireless Bluetooth, but you can hear that the sound is much worse. Connecting over Bluetooth lowers the quality a ton, and also occasionally means you need to disconnect, reconnect, etc.\nAll three of the Sennheisers above come in two-ear versions, which I prefer if I’m in a noisy environment, but at home I find the one-ear a bit more comfortable. I got excited about this $70 TaoTronics “Trucker Bluetooth” headset because it had Bluetooth 5.0 so I foolishly assumed it would have better quality, but it sounds really terrible:\nBut does wireless have to mean terrible quality? The Apple Airpods Pro ($249) are actually pretty decent, and you can easily switch them between your phone and your computer in the audio menu. If you haven’t tried the Pro version, the noise canceling is actually pretty amazing for something so small and light —\xa0I jog with them.\nAnd one of the best sounding mics in this entire roundup was the wireless $119 Antlion Audio ModMic Wireless, which sound amazing, but you have to provide your own headphones to attach it to, and the entire thing ends up being fairly bulky and has its own wireless adapter. On the plus side, you can bring your own super-fancy headphones and get amazing audio quality. With certain headphones it did cause a buzz in the ear of the headphone I attached it to.\nBut hot dang that sounds good. If they made an over-the-ear USB-C version with an earbud, and had the mic be a little smaller, it would be work-from-home nirvana.\nI ventured into the gaming headset territory for this SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless Gaming Headset, which at first felt totally ridiculous with its own connector box, a million cables, etc, but goshdarnit grew on me. It has this really cool boom mic\nthat extends out, and I think it’s the most comfortable headset I’ve worn for an extended amount of time. I tried it out via its proprietary 2.4ghz wireless connection + USB, and Bluetooth, and unfortunately the results weren’t great, including the Bluetooth being a little garbled. I hope Steelseries does another iteration because they’re so close, it just needs to be USB-C on the headphones, the cables, the everything, and super high quality recording.\nOne final entrant —\xa0how about just your laptop? Normally I would say this sounds terrible and judge people who didn’t use a headset, but John Gruber’s review of the new Macbook 16 had some really impressive audio files that intrigued me, so here it is, the Macbook Pro 16″, which starts at about $2,400. It’s a little boomy, but not bad.\nOkay now let’s get a little crazy. Here’s a Zoom H5 with the SGH6 shotgun mic attachment. (The other Zoom! $410 total.)\nNext up is the Shure SM7B Cardioid Dynamic, which is what I usually use to record the Distributed podcast, and costs about $400. This is milky and smooth. (I accidentally called it a Sennheiser in the recording.)\nA favorite of voiceover artists everywhere is the Sennheiser MKH416 Super-Cardioid Shotgun Tube Condenser ($1,000), which I like the sound of and I also use for if I’m doing a fancy video setup and want super-good sound that’s not in the frame of the camera.\nIt’s a great sound, but the part of the house where I recorded all of these is pretty noisy with an AC unit on the other side of the wall, and there’s a ton of background noise in this.\nSoftware eats the audio world\nJust like photography has been completely transformed by software enhancing images to the point where the top-of-the-line Apple or Samsung smartphone camera is better than all but the very top pro SLR cameras, I think the same thing is going to happen for audio.\nNone of these clips are processed, which is why some of the volume levels are different, but I thought it would be fun to demo a tool I’ve been recommending to a lot of people.\nThere’s a $40/year program called Krisp.ai, which I first learned about in 2018 from this awesome post on the Nvidia developer blog, Real-Time Noise Suppression Using Deep Learning. What it does is create a virtual microphone, like a filter that exists between one of your physical inputs and what the software on your computer “hears.” For fun I re-recorded the MKH416 in the exact same place, but filtered through Krisp.ai:\nNow the audio quality is not as good, it sounds a bit clipped, but throughout there is no more distracting background hums or noise. Krisp can be a little awkward to use but they’ve made it a lot more user friendly. You could mix Krisp with almost any option here and it would make it sound much better, in fact when I’m in a pinch my favorite go-to is Airpods Pro + Krisp.\nWith everything, a pro tip on MacOS is to hold Option when you click on the sound icon in your upper right taskbar, and it will let you select both input and output devices. Sound Preferences, linked at the bottom of that menu, are your friend. If a mic is too soft you can boost the input volume in the preferences. To choose a camera or mic in Zoom, click the arrow next to the mute button in the bottom left. In Zoom audio settings, under Advanced, they are starting to expose a number of new options for real-time audio processing.\nThe future sounds good.\nCategories\nAsides\nPhysical\xa0Distancing\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nMarch 18, 2020\n8 Comments on Physical\xa0Distancing\nI’ve really had enough of this term “social distancing.” That is not at all what we are looking for, is it?

(I have to get them on Distributed.) Here’s my part:\nA survey of American workers by the polling firm Gallup found that in 2016 43% of employees worked remotely at least some of the time, up from 39% in 2012. Of those remote workers, almost a third spent 80% or more of their time working remotely in 2016, compared to 24% in 2012. In computer-related professions, 57% did some remote work in 2016, according to Gallup.\xa0That includes tech companies like Automattic, which makes WordPress and other software products and has been almost entirely remote since it was founded in 2005. At one point, it opened a large office in San Francisco for employees who preferred a more traditional work environment, but it got rid of that space in 2016 because of how little people used it.\xa0\xa0“We had this 15,000-square-foot place with only five people coming into it,” said Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, which acquired Tumblr last year.\xa0Now Automattic rents only one small co-working space in a WeWork suite in New York\xa0 and uses another small office in San Francisco exclusively for board meetings. It manages its remote workforce using Slack and Zoom and gives new employees $2,000 so they can purchase home office equipment.\xa0Employees can also get up to $250 per month for access to a co-working space or for daily coffees at a local coffee shop. But Mullenweg says only about 300 of the company’s 1,200 employees chose to work somewhere other than a home office.“I hope there can be a silver lining to this crisis, which we all hope is over as soon as possible, that enables people to reexamine how they work and how they interact with things and improve it,” said Mullenweg. “I’m happy to spread the gospel wherever possible for distributed work. I think it’s better for companies, employees, the environment and the world. There are very few downsides.”\nThe Information is a worthwhile subscription if you’re in the tech business.\nCategories\nAsides\nSonny Rollins\xa0Interview\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nMarch 8, 2020\n3 Comments on Sonny Rollins\xa0Interview\nDavid Marchese at the\nNY Times has a beautiful interview with Sonny Rollins up.\nCategories\nAutomattic Future of Work\nCoronavirus and the Remote Work Experiment No One Asked\xa0For\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nMarch 5, 2020\n20 Comments on Coronavirus and the Remote Work Experiment No One Asked\xa0For\n“We’ll never probably be the same. People who were reticent to work remotely will find that they really thrive that way. Managers who didn’t think they could manage teams that were remote will have a different perspective. I do think we won’t go back.”Jennifer Christie, Twitter’s head of human resources, in BuzzFeed News\nThis is not how I envisioned the distributed work revolution taking hold.\nIt has been a challenging time around the world—from how we live our daily lives to how we keep our kids safe in schools and our family members healthy in assisted living communities and hospitals.\nAnd then there’s how we work. Seattle (and all of King County in Washington State) is encouraging companies to have their employees work from home. Given that Automattic is already distributed, we’re receiving requests from the press and other companies about how to navigate what is turning into a massive global work-from-home experiment.\nIt’s not ideal on any level. Even at a remote-friendly company like Automattic, we rely on in-person team meetups and conferences to strengthen our connections and get work done. For now, we’ve canceled all work-related travel.\nBut as the BuzzFeed story notes, this might also offer an opportunity for many companies to finally build a culture that allows long-overdue work flexibility. Millions of people will get the chance to experience days without long commutes, or the harsh inflexibility of not being able to stay close to home when a family member is sick.\nOr even when you’re sick yourself. How many people in America go into an office even when they’re feeling under the weather, because of pressure from the company or managers, or because their sick days come out of their vacation days? This might be a chance for a great reset in terms of how we work.\nFor those asking for tips, my Distributed Podcast has a wealth of advice and stories about how we operate. But here are four good ones to start with:\nOperate as if everyone works from different time zones, because one day they might. This means more communication, likely written, that is accessible to people even if they can’t attend a specific meeting or be in a specific place. If you can minimize the number of real-time meetings, do so. Embrace asynchronous communication.If you are hosting a real-time meeting, improve the audio (and video) quality. Don’t use conference call lines with grainy phone audio. Sign up for Zoom, which allows for crystal clear audio calls or videoconference chats. Make video participation optional unless it’s planned well in advance. Record these calls so folks who can’t attend can catch up on what they missed. Everyone must use good headphones with mics (I love Sennheiser) to minimize external noise. Krisp.ai is also cool. Need a quiet place without distractions? Try a parked car or a closet.We use our own WordPress blogs, called P2, instead of email as our central hub of communication so people throughout the company can access every team’s long-form notes, documents, and priorities. We’re bloggers by heart, so we blog a lot. There are other similar tools, like Basecamp. Make it your new office.\xa0\xa0We also use Slack for real-time chat, social connection, and urgent conversations. Check out Matrix for an open-source, distributed version. Use it to chat and connect with your colleagues, but don’t let it replace your long-form planning notes in No. 3. Also create an etiquette that doesn’t force people to become chained to it all day and all night. When you ask a question in DM, do not expect that person to respond immediately, and ask your question upfront. Never write “got a sec?” and let it hang there. 😁\nThe truth is, there are a thousand ways to do remote work, but it starts with committing to it at all levels of the company. If you assume positive intent and place trust in your coworkers and employees—knowing that if they do great work in an office they can do great work anywhere—then you will all succeed.\nCategories\nAsides\nLivestream\xa0Tomorrow\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nFebruary 20, 2020\n2 Comments on Livestream\xa0Tomorrow\nAbout eight of the speakers including myself are going to be doing a livestream tomorrow from 2 to 10 UTC, or what would be 9am to 5pm in Bangkok where the inaugural WordCamp Asia was supposed to happen this weekend.\nWe’d all much rather be in person, but I do think there is a silver lining in us learning how to do official WordPress livestream events that can be accessible to everyone all over the world, following in the footsteps awesome virtual events like WordSesh.\nCategories\nAsides\nThirty\xa0Six\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nJanuary 11, 2020\n17 Comments on Thirty\xa0Six\nI am now solidly entering my late thirties, and fortunately I am in good health, good cheer, and doing one of my favorite things — exploring a part of the world and culture I haven’t experienced before (Maldives and Sri Lanka).\nThe past year has included a number of professional milestones including a significant amount of fundraising and related activity, bringing in a major new product to the Automattic family, the maturation of Gutenberg in the WordPress ecosystem, launching the Distributed blog and podcast, and a growth in the breadth and depth of the Automattic team.\nPartially because of the schedule those milestones required, this ended up being my year with the most travel ever since I started tracking: I flew over 515k miles, to 124 cities in 24 countries. I was able to incorporate a good amount of running in my routine, started picking up musical instruments again, and learning more about sound and its impact on our lives. I found small daily habits, like a little bit of exercise or stretching first thing in the morning, to be sustainable and high-impact.\nWhat suffered in 2019 was my book reading time and making a dent on the top 50 list. I still check tech news every day, but I had to unplug from daily non-tech news because it was just too hectic — I’ve found a lot of value in weekly publications like the Economist to make sense of what’s going on in the world with the benefit of a little distance and time.\nPersonally my main goals this year are for the health and wellness of my family, incorporating more playing music and photography into my life, and strengthening my meditation practice. If you’re reading this, I hope to run into you online or in person and this year let’s do our best together to leave the world a little better than we found it.\nCategories\nAsides\n29 Books in\xa02019\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nJanuary 1, 2020\n20 Comments on 29 Books in\xa02019\nAs a follow-on to my lists in 2017 and 2018, here are the books I completed this year. I’ve linked all to the Kindle edition except the Great Mental Models, which is so gorgeous in hardcover you should get that one, and the The World is Sound isn’t available as an ebook. Bold are ones I particularly enjoyed or found myself discussing with others a lot.\nThe Pilgrimage by Paulo Coehlo21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah HarariNo Longer at Ease by Chinua AchebeImagine it Forward by Beth ComstockThe Great Mental Models Vol. 1 by Shane ParrishWhy Buddhism is True by Robert WrightThere Will Be No Miracles Here by Casey GeraldLess by Andrew Sean GreerBad Blood by John Carreyrounejma by Nayyirah WaheedTrust Exercise by Susan Choi (also on Obama’s book list, and based on the high school I went to, HSPVA)Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack WeatherfordThe Way to Love by Anthony de MelloThe Fifth Agreement by Don Miguel Ruiz, Don Jose Ruiz, and Janet MillsEmpty Planet by Darrell BrickerBrave New World by Aldous HuxleyHow to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk by Adele Faber and Elian MazlishMake it Scream, Make it Burn by Leslie JamisonA Short History of Progress by Ronald WrightConscious: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind by Annaka HarrisThe World Is Sound: Nada Brahma: Music and the Landscape of Consciousness by Joachim-Ernst BerendtThe 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership by Jim Dethmer and Diana ChapmanFinite and Infinite Games by James P. CarseFour Soldiers by Hubert MingarelliWorking by Robert CaroAttached by Amir Levine and Rachel HellerSkin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas TalebThe Devil’s Financial Dictionary by Jason ZweigHow to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy by Jenny Odell (also on Obama’s book list)\nWhat’s interesting is that if you were to purchase every single one of those books, it would be about $349. You could get them all for nothing from your local library, even on a Kindle. The money I spend on books is by far and away the best investment I make every year —\xa0books expand my mind and enrich my life in a way that nothing else does.\nCategories\nAsides\nComments and Collatz\xa0Conundrum\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nDecember 16, 2019\n5 Comments on Comments and Collatz\xa0Conundrum\nOver the summer Terence Tao, a Fields Medal-winning mathematician considered one of the best of his generation, got an anonymous comment on his WordPress blog post from 2011 exploring the Collatz conjecture — one of the most persistent problems in math — suggesting he explore the problem for “almost all” numbers. Terence has been a regular WP.com blogger since 2007 and he and his commenters make extensive use of our LaTeX feature to express and embed equations.\nThat anonymous comment led him to an important breakthrough on the Collatz Conundrum, as Quanta Magazine reports. If you want great comments, you as the author have to participate in them and Terence is incredibly active in engaging with the commenters on his site.\nI’ve always said that comments are the best part of blogging, but this is a particularly cool example. Here’s Terence’s latest post on it, with an excellent comment thread following.\nCategories\nAsides\nPowering Your\xa0House\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nNovember 30, 2019\n1 Comment on Powering Your\xa0House\nI enjoyed this fun video from xkcd’s Randall Munroe on different ways you could power your home, illustrated. Check out his book How To for more in the same vein.\nCategories\nFuture of Work\nDistributed Podcast: Clark Valberg, Lydia X. Z. Brown, Stephen Wolfram, and the Grand\xa0Meetup\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nNovember 26, 2019\nIf y’all haven’t caught up recently with my podcast Distributed, this is a perfect moment to do so—the past several weeks have been full of insights from folks like InVision CEO Clark Valberg, attorney and advocate Lydia X. Z. Brown, Stephen Wolfram, and some of my own Automattic colleagues in-person at our Grand Meetup.\nYou can subscribe at Apple Podcasts, Google, Overcast, Spotify, or wherever you like to listen.\nContinue reading “Distributed Podcast: Clark Valberg, Lydia X.

Shane is a fascinating person — he’s a former cybersecurity expert for the Canadian intelligence agency and occasional blogger who turned his website into a full-time career. Oh and fs.blog is on WordPress, too. 😎\nHis book, The Great Mental Models: General Thinking Concepts, has been tremendously valuable to me in my work. So valuable, in fact, that Automattic is now sponsoring the next printing of the hardcover edition. You can pre-order it here, then learn more about the mental models outlined in it.\nTags\nWork, productivity\nCategories\nWordCamp WordPress\nState of the Word\xa02019\nPost author\nBy Matt\nPost date\nNovember 5, 2019\n6 Comments on State of the Word\xa02019\nIn case you missed it, here’s the first-ever State of the Word… designed completely in Gutenberg:\nWordCamp US was a fantastic experience, as always. Thank you again to the hundreds of organizers and volunteers who made it happen, to the thousands who attended, and to the city of St. Louis for hosting us. We’ll be back there again next year.\nAnd special thanks to this next generation of WordPress contributors. So exciting to see KidsCamps continue to expand and thrive:\nThank you @photomatt for stopping by KidsCamp today. The kids loved your visit! #WordPress #KidsCamp #WCUS pic.twitter.com/cq65sHkjsI— Sandy Edwards (@sunsanddesign) November 3, 2019\nAs you can see, my site is now featuring the new WordPress Twenty Twenty theme.
